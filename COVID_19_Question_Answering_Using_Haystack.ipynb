Over the last 20 years, there has been a substantial decrease in the incidence of childhood pneumonia and pneumonia-associated mortality. New conjugate vaccines against Haemophilus influenzae type b and Streptococcus pneumoniae have contributed to decreases in radiologic, clinical and complicated pneumonia cases and have reduced hospitalization and mortality. The importance of co-infections with multiple pathogens and the predominance of viral-associated disease are emerging. Better access to effective preventative and management strategies is needed in low- and middle-income countries, while new strategies are needed to address the residual burden of disease once these have been implemented.\\n\\nText: Pneumonia has been the leading cause of death in children younger than 5 years for decades. Although there have been substantial decreases in overall child mortality and in pneumonia-specific mortality, pneumonia remains the major single cause of death in children outside the neonatal period, causing approximately 900,000 of the estimated 6.3 million child deaths in 2013 [1] . Substantial advances have occurred in the understanding of risk factors and etiology of pneumonia, in development of standardized case definitions, and in prevention with the production of improved vaccines and in treatment. Such advances have led to changes in the epidemiology, etiology and mortality from childhood pneumonia. However in many areas access to these interventions remains sub-optimal, with large inequities between and within countries and regions. In this paper we review the impact of recent preventative and management advances in pneumonia epidemiology, etiology, radiologic presentation and outcome in children.\\n\\nThe overall burden of childhood pneumonia has been reduced substantially over the last decade, despite an increase in the global childhood population from 605 million in 2000 to 664 million in 2015 [2] . Recent data suggest that there has been a 25% decrease in the incidence of pneumonia, from 0.29 episodes per child year in low-and middle-income countries in 2000, to 0.22 episodes per child year in 2010 [3] . This is substantiated by a 58% decrease in pneumonia-associated disability-adjusted life years between 1990 and 2013, from 186 million to 78 million as estimated in the Global Burden of Disease study [1] . Pneumonia deaths decreased from 1.8 million in 2000 to 900,000 in 2013 [1] . These data do not reflect the full impact of increasingly widespread use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in low-and middle-income countries because the incidence of pneumonia and number of deaths are likely to decrease still further as a result of this widespread intervention [4] .\\n\\nNotwithstanding this progress, there remains a disproportionate burden of disease in low-and middle-income countries, where more than 90% of pneumonia cases and deaths occur. The incidence in high-income countries is estimated at 0.015 episodes per child year, compared to 0.22 episodes per child year in low-and middle-income countries [3] . On average, 1 in 66 children in high-income countries is affected by pneumonia per year, compared to 1 in 5 children in low-and middle-income countries. Even within low-and middleincome countries there are regional inequities and challenges with access to health care services: up to 81% of severe pneumonia deaths occur outside a hospital [5] . In addition to a higher incidence of pneumonia, the case fatality rate is estimated to be almost 10-fold higher in low-and middle-income countries as compared to high-income countries [3, 5] .\\n\\nChildhood pneumonia can also lead to significant morbidity and chronic disease. Early life pneumonia can impair longterm lung health by decreasing lung function [6] . Severe or recurrent pneumonia can have a worse effect on lung function; increasing evidence suggests that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease might be related to early childhood pneumonia [7, 8] . A meta-analysis of the risk of long-term outcomes after childhood pneumonia categorized chronic respiratory sequelae into major (restrictive lung disease, obstructive lung disease, bronchiectasis) and minor (chronic bronchitis, asthma, abnormal pulmonary function) groups [9] . The risk of developing at least one of the major sequelae was estimated as 6% after an ambulatory pneumonia event and 14% after an episode of hospitalized pneumonia. Because respiratory diseases affect almost 1 billion people globally and are a major cause of mortality and morbidity [10] , childhood pneumonia might contribute to substantial morbidity across the life course.\\n\\nChest radiologic changes have been considered the gold standard for defining a pneumonia event [11] because clinical findings can be subjective and clinical definitions of pneumonia can be nonspecific. In 2005, to aid in defining outcomes of pneumococcal vaccine studies, the World Health Organization\\'s (WHO) standardized chest radiograph description defined a group of children who were considered most likely to have pneumococcal pneumonia [12] . The term \"end-point consolidation\" was described as a dense or fluffy opacity that occupies a portion or whole of a lobe, or the entire lung. \"Other infiltrate\" included linear and patchy densities, peribronchial thickening, minor patchy infiltrates that are not of sufficient magnitude to constitute primary end-point consolidation, and small areas of atelectasis that in children can be difficult to distinguish from consolidation. \"Primary end-point pneumonia\" included either end-point consolidation or a pleural effusion associated with a pulmonary parenchymal infiltrate (including \"other\" infiltrate).\\n\\nWidespread use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination and Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccination has decreased the incidence of radiologic pneumonia. In a review of four randomized controlled trials and two case-control studies of Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccination in high-burden communities, the vaccination was associated with an 18% decrease in radiologic pneumonia [13] . Introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination was associated with a 26% decrease in radiologic pneumonia in California between 1995 and 1998 [14] . In vaccine efficacy trials in low-and middle-income countries, pneumococcal conjugate vaccination reduced radiologic pneumonia by 37% in the Gambia [15] , 25% in South Africa [16] and 26% in the Philippines [17] .\\n\\nThe WHO radiologic case definition was not intended to distinguish bacterial from viral etiology but rather to define a sub-set of pneumonia cases in which pneumococcal infection was considered more likely and to provide a set of standardized definitions through which researchers could achieve broad agreement in reporting chest radiographs. However, despite widespread field utilization, there are concerns regarding inter-observer repeatability. There has been good consensus for the description of lobar consolidation but significant disagreement on the description of patchy and perihilar infiltrates [18, 19] . In addition, many children with clinically severe lung disease do not have primary end-point pneumonia: in one pre-pneumococcal conjugate vaccination study, only 34% of children hospitalized with pneumonia had primary end-point pneumonia [20] . A revised case definition of \"presumed bacterial pneumonia\" has been introduced, and this definition includes pneumonia cases with WHO-defined alveolar consolidation, as well as those with other abnormal chest radiograph infiltrates and a serum C-reactive protein of at least 40 mg/L [21, 22] . This definition has been shown to have greater sensitivity than the original WHO radiologic definition of primary end-point pneumonia for detecting the burden of pneumonia prevented by pneumococcal conjugate vaccination [23] . Using the revised definition, the 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-10), had a vaccine efficacy of 22% in preventing presumed bacterial pneumonia in young children in South America [22] , and pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-13 had a vaccine efficacy of 39% in preventing presumed bacterial pneumonia in children older than 16 weeks who were not infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in South Africa [21] . Thus there is convincing evidence that pneumococcal conjugate vaccination decreases the incidence of radiologic pneumonia; however there is no evidence to suggest that pneumococcal conjugate vaccination modifies the radiologic appearance of pneumococcal pneumonia.\\n\\nEmpyema is a rare complication of pneumonia. An increased incidence of empyema in children was noted in some high-income countries following pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7 introduction, and this was attributed to pneumococcal serotypes not included in pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7, especially 3 and 19A [24] . In the United States, evidence from a national hospital database suggests that the incidence of empyema increased 1.9-fold between 1996 and 2008 [25] . In Australia, the incidence rate ratio increased by 1.4 times when comparing the pre-pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7 period (1998 to 2004) to the post-pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7 period (2005 to 2010) [26] . In Scotland, incidence of empyema in children rose from 6.5 per million between 1981 and 1998, to 66 per million in 2005 [27] . These trends have been reversed since the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-13. Data from the United States suggest that empyema decreased by 50% in children younger than 5 years [28] ; similarly, data from the United Kingdom and Scotland showed substantial reduction in pediatric empyema following pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-13 introduction [29, 30] .\\n\\nSeveral national guidelines from high-income countries, as well as the WHO recommendations for low-and middleincome countries, recommend that chest radiography should not be routinely performed in children with ambulatory pneumonia [31] [32] [33] . Indications for chest radiography include hospitalization, severe hypoxemia or respiratory distress, failed initial antibiotic therapy, or suspicion for other diseases (tuberculosis, inhaled foreign body) or complications. However, point-of-care lung ultrasound is emerging as a promising modality for diagnosing childhood pneumonia [34] .\\n\\nIn addition to the effect on radiologic pneumonia, pneumococcal conjugate vaccination reduces the risk of hospitalization from viral-associated pneumonia, probably by reducing bacterial-viral co-infections resulting in severe disease and hospitalization [35] . An analysis of ecological and observational studies of pneumonia incidence in different age groups soon after introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7 in Canada, Italy, Australia, Poland and the United States showed decreases in all-cause pneumonia hospitalizations ranging from 15% to 65% [36] . In the United States after pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-13 replaced pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7, there was a further 17% decrease in hospitalizations for pneumonia among children eligible for the vaccination, and a further 12% decrease among unvaccinated adults [28] .\\n\\nA systematic review of etiology studies prior to availability of new conjugate vaccines confirmed S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae type B as the most important bacterial causes of pneumonia, with Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae associated with some severe cases. Respiratory syncytial virus was the leading viral cause, identified in 15-40% of pneumonia cases, followed by influenza A and B, parainfluenza, human metapneumovirus and adenovirus [37] .\\n\\nMore recent meta-analyses of etiology data suggest a changing pathogen profile, with increasing recognition that clinical pneumonia is caused by the sequential or concurrent interaction of more than one organism. Severe disease in particular is often caused by multiple pathogens. With high coverage of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination and Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccination, viral pathogens increasingly predominate [38] . In recent case-control studies, at least one virus was detected in 87% of clinical pneumonia cases in South Africa [39] , while viruses were detected in 81% of radiologic pneumonia cases in Sweden [40] . In a large multi-center study in the United States, viral pathogens were detected in 73% of children hospitalized with radiologic pneumonia, while bacteria were detected in only 15% of cases [41] . A meta-analysis of 23 case-control studies of viral etiology in radiologically confirmed pneumonia in children, completed up to 2014, reported good evidence of causal attribution for respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, metapneumovirus and parainfluenza virus [42] . However there was no consistent evidence that many other commonly described viruses, including rhinovirus, adenovirus, bocavirus and coronavirus, were more commonly isolated from cases than from controls. Further attribution of bacterial etiology is difficult because it is often not possible to distinguish colonizing from pathogenic bacteria when they are isolated from nasal specimens [43] .\\n\\nAnother etiology is pertussis. In the last decade there has also been a resurgence in pertussis cases, especially in highincome countries [44] . Because pertussis immunity after acellular pertussis vaccination is less long-lasting than immunity after wild-type infection or whole-cell vaccination, many women of child-bearing age have waning pertussis antibody levels. Their infants might therefore be born with low transplacental anti-pertussis immunoglobulin G levels, making them susceptible to pertussis infection before completion of the primary vaccination series [45] . In 2014, more than 40,000 pertussis cases were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States; in some states, population-based incidence rates are higher than at any time in the last 70 years [44] . In contrast, most low-and middleincome countries use whole-cell pertussis vaccines and the numbers of pertussis cases in those countries were stable or decreasing until 2015 [46] . However recent evidence from South Africa (where the acellular vaccine is used) shows an appreciable incidence of pertussis among infants presenting with acute pneumonia: 2% of clinical pneumonia cases among infants enrolled in a birth cohort were caused by pertussis [39] , and 3.7% of infants and young children presenting to a tertiary academic hospital had evidence of pertussis infection [47] .\\n\\nSimilarly, childhood tuberculosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in many low-and middle-income countries, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis has increasingly been recognized as a pathogen in acute pneumonia in children living in high tuberculosis-prevalence settings. Postmortem studies of children dying from acute respiratory illness have commonly reported M. tuberculosis [48, 49] . A recent systematic review of tuberculosis as a comorbidity of childhood pneumonia reported culture-confirmed disease in about 8% of cases [50] . Because intrathoracic tuberculosis disease is only culture-confirmed in a minority of cases, the true burden could be even higher; tuberculosis could therefore be an important contributor to childhood pneumonia incidence and mortality in high-prevalence areas.\\n\\nChildhood pneumonia and clinically severe disease result from a complex interaction of host and environmental risk factors [37] . Because of the effectiveness of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination and Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccination for prevention of radiologic and clinical pneumonia, incomplete or inadequate vaccination must be considered as a major preventable risk factor for childhood pneumonia. Other risk factors include low birth weight, which is associated with 3.2 times increased odds of severe pneumonia in low-and middle-income countries, and 1.8 times increased odds in high-income countries [51] . Similarly, lack of exclusive breastfeeding for the first 4 months of life increases odds of severe pneumonia by 2.7 times in low-and middle-income countries and 1.3 times in highincome countries. Markers of undernutrition are strong risk factors for pneumonia in low-and middle-income countries only, with highly significant odds ratios for underweight for age (4.5), stunting (2.6) and wasting (2.8) . Household crowding has uniform risk, with odds ratios between 1.9 and 2.3 in both low-and middle-income countries and high-income countries. Indoor air pollution from use of solid or biomass fuels increases odds of pneumonia by 1.6 times; lack of measles vaccination by the end of the first year of age increases odds of pneumonia by 1.8 times [51] . It is estimated that the prevalence of these critical risk factors in low-and middle-income countries decreased by 25% between 2000 and 2010, contributing to reductions in pneumonia incidence and mortality in low-and middle-income countries, even in countries where conjugate vaccines have not been available [3] .\\n\\nThe single strongest risk factor for pneumonia is HIV infection, which is especially prevalent in children in sub-Saharan Africa. HIV-infected children have 6 times increased odds of developing severe pneumonia or of death compared to HIV-uninfected children [52] . Since the effective prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV, there is a growing population of HIV-exposed children who are uninfected; their excess risk of pneumonia, compared to HIV unexposed children, has been described as 1.3-to 3.4-fold higher [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] .\\n\\nThe pneumococcal conjugate vaccination and Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccination have been effective tools to decrease pneumonia incidence, severity and mortality [58, 59] . However, equitable coverage and access to vaccines remains sub-optimal. By the end of 2015, Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccination had been introduced in 73 countries, with global coverage estimated at 68%. However, inequities are still apparent among regions: in the Americas coverage is estimated at 90%, while in the Western Pacific it is only 25%. By 2015, pneumococcal conjugate vaccination had been introduced into 54 countries, with global coverage of 35% for three doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination for infant populations [60] . To address this issue, the WHO\\'s Global Vaccine Access Plan initiative was launched to make life-saving vaccines more equitably available. In addition to securing guarantees for financing of vaccines, the program objectives include building political will in low-and middle-income countries to commit to immunization as a priority, social marketing to individuals and communities, strengthening health systems and promoting relevant local research and development innovations [61] .\\n\\nMaternal vaccination to prevent disease in the youngest infants has been shown to be effective for tetanus, influenza and pertussis [62] . Influenza vaccination during pregnancy is safe, provides reasonable maternal protection against influenza, and also protects infants for a limited period from confirmed influenza infection (vaccine efficacy 63% in Bangladesh [63] and 50.4% in South Africa [64] ). However as antibody levels drop sharply after birth, infant protection does not persist much beyond 8 weeks [65] . Recently respiratory syncytial virus vaccination in pregnancy has been shown to be safe and immunogenic, and a phase-3 clinical trial of efficacy at preventing respiratory syncytial virus disease in infants is under way [66] . Within a decade, respiratory syncytial virus in infancy might be vaccine-preventable, with further decreases in pneumonia incidence, morbidity and mortality [67] .\\n\\nImproved access to health care, better nutrition and improved living conditions might contribute to further decreases in childhood pneumonia burden. The WHO Integrated Global Action Plan for diarrhea and pneumonia highlights many opportunities to protect, prevent and treat children [68] . Breastfeeding rates can be improved by programs that combine education and counseling interventions in homes, communities and health facilities, and by promotion of baby-friendly hospitals [69] . Improved home ventilation, cleaner cooking fuels and reduction in exposure to cigarette smoke are essential interventions to reduce the incidence and severity of pneumonia [70, 71] . Prevention of pediatric HIV is possible by providing interventions to prevent mother-to-child transmission [72] . Early infant HIV testing and early initiation of antiretroviral therapy and cotrimoxazole prophylaxis can substantially reduce the incidence of community-acquired pneumonia among HIV-infected children [73] . Community-based interventions reduce pneumonia mortality and have the indirect effect of improved-careseeking behavior [58] . If these cost-effective interventions were scaled up, it is estimated that 67% of pneumonia deaths in lowand middle-income countries could be prevented by 2025 [58] .\\n\\nCase management of pneumonia is a strategy by which severity of disease is classified as severe or non-severe. All children receive early, appropriate oral antibiotics, and severe cases are referred for parenteral antibiotics. When implemented in highburden areas before the availability of conjugate vaccines, case management as part of Integrated Management of Childhood Illness was associated with a 27% decrease in overall child mortality, and 42% decrease in pneumonia-specific mortality [74] . However the predominance of viral causes of pneumonia and low case fatality have prompted concern about overuse of antibiotics. Several randomized controlled trials comparing oral antibiotics to placebo for non-severe pneumonia have been performed [75] [76] [77] and others are ongoing [78] . In two studies, performed in Denmark and in India, outcomes of antibiotic and placebo treatments were equivalent [76, 77] . In the third study, in Pakistan, there was a non-significant 24% vs. 20% rate of failure in the placebo group, which was deemed to be non-equivalent to the antibiotic group [75] . Furthermore, because WHO-classified non-severe pneumonia and bronchiolitis might be considered within a spectrum of lower respiratory disease, many children with clinical pneumonia could actually have viral bronchiolitis, for which antibiotics are not beneficial [79] . This has been reflected in British [33] and Spanish [31] national pneumonia guidelines, which do not recommend routine antibiotic treatment for children younger than 2 years with evidence of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination who present with non-severe pneumonia. The United States\\' national guidelines recommend withholding antibiotics in children up to age 5 years presenting with non-severe pneumonia [32] . However, given the high mortality from pneumonia in low-and middle-income countries, the lack of easy access to care, and the high prevalence of risk factors for severe disease, revised World Health Organization pneumonia guidelines still recommend antibiotic treatment for all children who meet the WHO pneumonia case definitions [80] .\\n\\nUse of supplemental oxygen is life-saving, but this is not universally available in low-and middle-income countries; it is estimated that use of supplemental oxygen systems could reduce mortality of children with hypoxic pneumonia by 20% [81] . Identifying systems capacity to increase availability of oxygen in health facilities, and identifying barriers to further implementation are among the top 15 priorities for future childhood pneumonia research [82] . However, up to 81% of pneumonia deaths in 2010 occurred outside health facilities [5] , so there are major challenges with access to health services and health-seeking behavior of vulnerable populations. Identifying and changing the barriers to accessing health care is an important area with the potential to impact the survival and health of the most vulnerable children [82] .\\n\\nMuch progress has been made in decreasing deaths caused by childhood pneumonia. Improved socioeconomic status and vaccinations, primarily the conjugate vaccines (against Haemophilus influenzae and pneumococcus), have led to substantial reductions in the incidence and severity of childhood pneumonia. Stronger strategies to prevent and manage HIV have reduced HIV-associated pneumonia deaths. However, despite the substantial changes in incidence, etiology and radiology globally, there remain inequities in access to care and availability of effective interventions, especially in low-and middle-income countries. Effective interventions need to be more widely available and new interventions developed for the residual burden of childhood pneumonia.'}}>,\n",

No approved drug is available for the specific treatment of JEV infections, and the available vaccines are not effective against all clinical JEV isolates. In the study described here, a high-throughput screening of an FDA-approved drug library for inhibitors of JEV was performed. Five hit drugs that inhibited JEV infection with a selective index of >10 were identified. The antiviral activities of these five hit drugs against other flavivirus, including Zika virus, were also validated. As three of the five hit drugs were calcium inhibitors, additional types of calcium inhibitors that confirmed that calcium is essential for JEV infection, most likely during viral replication, were utilized. Adaptive mutant analysis uncovered that replacement of Q130, located in transmembrane domain 3 of the nonstructural NS4B protein, which is relatively conserved in flaviviruses, with R or K conferred JEV resistance to manidipine, a voltage-gated Ca(2+) channel (VGCC) inhibitor, without an apparent loss of the viral growth profile. Furthermore, manidipine was indicated to protect mice against JEV-induced lethality by decreasing the viral load in the brain, while it abrogated the histopathological changes associated with JEV infection. This study provides five antiflavivirus candidates and identifies cytoplasmic calcium to be a novel antiviral target for the treatment of JEV infection. The findings reported here provide therapeutic possibilities for combating infections caused by flaviviruses. IMPORTANCE No approved therapy for the treatment of Japanese encephalitis virus infection is currently available. Repurposing of approved drugs would accelerate the development of a therapeutic stratagem. In this study, we screened a library of FDA-approved drugs and identified five hit drugs, especially calcium inhibitors, exerting antiflavivirus activity that blocked viral replication. The in vivo efficacy and toxicity of manidipine were investigated with a mouse model of JEV infection, and the viral target was identified by generating an adaptive mutant.\\n\\nText: F laviviruses are taxonomically classified in the genus Flavivirus and family Flaviviridae.\\n\\nThese viruses comprise over 70 different pathogens, such as Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), Zika virus (ZIKV), dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), and yellow fever virus (YFV). Most flaviviruses are arthropod borne and cause public health problems worldwide (1) . The development and usage of vaccines against some flaviviruses, such as JEV, YFV, and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), have decreased the rates of morbidity and mortality from infections caused by these viruses (2) ; however, flavivirus-induced diseases are still pandemic, and few therapies beyond intensive supportive care are currently available.\\n\\nFlaviviruses have an approximately 11-kb positive-stranded RNA genome containing a single open reading frame (ORF) flanked by untranslated regions (UTRs) at both termini. The ORF encodes three structural proteins, including the capsid (C), membrane (premembrane [prM] and membrane [M] ), and envelope (E), and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) (3) . These seven nonstructural proteins participate in viral replication, virion assembly, and virus escape from immune surveillance.\\n\\nTo date, no specific antivirals with activity against flaviviruses are available. To address this, we conducted a screen of a library of 1,018 FDA-approved drugs. Since flaviviruses are similar in structure and pathogenesis, we first utilized JEV as the prototype to screen the drug library and subsequently validated the antiviral activities with ZIKV, WNV, and DENV type 2 (DENV-2). The hit drugs identified in this study offer potential new therapies for the treatment of flavivirus infection and disease.\\n\\nScreening of an FDA-approved drug library for inhibitors of JEV infection. Recombinant viral particles (RVPs) with the luciferase-reporting replicon enveloped by the JEV structural proteins were used to select inhibitors, with a focus on those that inhibit virus entry and replication, by a high-throughput screening (HTS) assay (4, 5) . The number of genomic RNA copies of RVP was determined to be 8.4 ϫ 10 6 copies/ml by using a standard curve generated with plasmids carrying the infectious clone. The HTS assay conditions, including the seeding cell density and RVP dose, were optimized to be 10,000 cells per 96-well plate and 20 l (16 copies/cell) RVP for the infective dose, respectively. Under the optimized conditions, the signal-to-basal (S/B) ratio, coefficient of variation (CV), and Z= factor were 38,374, 2.8%, and 0.89, respectively, which demonstrated that the assay was robust and suitable for the large-scale screening of compounds.\\n\\nA schematic of the HTS assay is depicted in Fig. 1B . After three rounds of screening, five hits with a selective index (SI; which is equal to the 50% cytotoxic concentration [CC 50 [/50% inhibitory concentration [IC 50 ]) of Ͼ10 were selected. The CC 50 values of the hit drugs exhibited in Fig. 1B were similar to those previously published for diverse cell systems but determined using different toxicity assays (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) . Three of the hit drugs, manidipine, cilnidipine, and benidipine hydrochloride, were dihydropyridine (DHP) voltage-gated Ca 2ϩ channel (VGCC) antagonists, while pimecrolimus is an inhibitor of inflammatory cytokine secretion and nelfinavir mesylate is an HIV-1 protease blocker. All five drugs exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of JEV RVP infection (Fig. 1C) . To validate the antiviral effect, hit drugs were purchased from other commercial sources and tested. In the reconfirmation screen, all hit drugs showed antiviral and cytotoxic effects similar to those found in the primary screen.\\n\\nValidation of hit drugs. To verify the results obtained by the luciferase reporter assays, we also investigated the antiviral effect of the five hit drugs on wild-type JEV strain AT31. As expected from the HTS assay, all five drugs robustly inhibited virus production, with a reduction of approximately 4 to 5 log units at the highest concentration and an approximately 1-log-unit decrease with 2.5 M the drugs (Fig. 2B) . A sharp decrease in JEV RNA levels was also detected (Fig. 2C) . The attenuated RNA levels in the high-dose, middle-dose, and low-dose groups were all above 40%. In particular, in the manidipine-treated group, the inhibitory effect was at least 80% compared to that for the control, which showed a strong inhibition of viral replication. Consistent with the inhibition of virus replication and production, expression of the viral structural protein prM was hardly detectable following treatment with the drugs at the high concentration (Fig. 2D) . Overall, the results in Fig. 2 confirmed that the five hit drugs inhibited JEV infection in a dose-dependent manner in vitro.\\n\\nDrugs inhibit JEV infection during viral RNA synthesis. Because RVPs, which have a natural virus-like envelope on the outside and a replicon on the inside, permitted the quantification of JEV productive entry and replication, a time-of-addition experiment was performed to investigate whether the hit drugs blocked the entry step or the replication step. As shown in Fig. 3B , no suppression of luciferase activity by any of the hit drugs was observed when they were used as treatments before infection or during infection or as a virucide, suggesting that these drugs do not inhibit JEV infection either by inactivating the virus directly or by blocking JEV entry. However, these drugs exerted fully inhibitory effects when they were added at 1 h postinfection, suggesting that viral replication was the stage at which these drugs showed inhibitory activity.\\n\\nTo confirm this suggestion, we investigated the inhibitory effects of these drugs on the JEV replicon. The highest concentration of manidipine and nelfinavir mesylate tested in baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells was adjusted to 5 M and 10 M, respectively. It was shown that all five drugs inhibited JEV RNA synthesis in a dosedependent manner, while neither drug inhibited the initial translation of replicon RNA (5, 14) (Fig. 3C) , confirming that these drugs inhibited JEV infection at the stage of replication.\\n\\nHit drugs exhibit broad-spectrum antiflavivirus activity. In order to determine whether the antiviral activity of the five hit drugs extended to other flaviviruses, we explored their antiviral effect against ZIKV. Similar to the findings for JEV, the ZIKV titer was decreased by multiple log units when ZIKV was treated with a high concentration of each of the drugs (Fig. 4A) . Moreover, ZIKV exhibited a higher sensitivity to the two calcium channels inhibitors manidipine and cilnidipine than JEV, with no plaque formation being observed at 10 M. Consistent with this result, sharp decreases in the level of replication of ZIKV RNA and the level of expression of viral protein were also detected (Fig. 4A) . Notably, treatment with 5 M manidipine produced a 95% inhibition of viral replication, translation, and viral yields. Taken together, these results indicate that the hit drugs could effectively inhibit ZIKV infection.\\n\\nSince these drugs exhibited their anti-JEV effects at the stage of viral replication, we further tested the effects against WNV and DENV-2 by using WNV and DENV-2 replicons. Similar to the results for JEV, a dose-dependent reduction in the level of WNV replication was observed with the drug treatments. The same phenotype was observed for DENV-2 for all drugs except nelfinavir mesylate, which showed no effect at the concentrations tested ( Fig. 4B and C). Together, these results indicate that the five hit drugs are excellent candidates for broad-spectrum antiflavivirus treatment. Antiviral effect of calcium inhibitors. Since three hit drugs, manidipine, cilnidipine, and benidipine hydrochloride, were DHP VGCC inhibitors, we asked whether other calcium antagonists could block JEV infection. To address this question, we employed four different classes of inhibitors. Verapamil, a prototype phenylalkylamine (PAA) VGCC inhibitor (15) , exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of JEV on both African Green monkey kidney (Vero) and human hepatocellular carcinoma (Huh-7) cells (Fig. 5) , which was consistent with the inhibitory effects of the DHP inhibitors, suggesting that calcium channels play an important role in JEV infection. Cyclosporine and 2-aminobiphenyl borate (2-APB), which inhibit the efflux of Ca 2ϩ from the mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) pool, respectively (16) (17) (18) (19) , were also found to block JEV infection effectively. Similarly, treatment with the cell-permeant Ca 2ϩ chelator 1,2-bis-(o-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N=,N=-tetraacetic acid, tetraacetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA-AM), could also suppress JEV infection. Taken together, we concluded that intracellular Ca 2ϩ is essential for JEV infection and cytoplasmic calcium is a potent target for antiflavivirus treatment.\\n\\nSelection and characterization of manidipine-resistant JEV. To identify the viral target of the calcium channel inhibitor, we selected a manidipine-resistant virus by serially passaging JEV in the presence of manidipine. Viruses from passage 20 (P20) showed robust resistance compared with the wild type (WT) (Fig. 6A ). When JEV from P20 was treated with 5 M or 10 M manidipine, the viral titer was about 10-and 100-fold higher than that of the WT, respectively. Individual virus clones were isolated, and two isolates were randomly selected and amplified. An amino acid substitution was observed in two isolated clones, resulting in a glutamine (Q)-to-arginine (R) switch at amino acid position 130 in transmembrane domain 3 (TMD3) of NS4B, i.e., position 2401 of the translated polyprotein in the JEV infectious cDNA clone (Fig. 6B ). Sequence alignment of NS4B indicated that Q130 was conserved in all flaviviruses except YFV, which possessed a lysine at that position (Fig.  6B) . The conserved Q130 of NS4B may account for the sensitivity of JEV, ZIKV, WNV, and DENV-2 to manidipine, as described above (Fig. 4) , while YFV showed resistance to the drug (data not shown).\\n\\nTo confirm that the Q130R mutation did confer manidipine resistance and to investigate the role of Q130 in NS4B function, we produced JEV clones with the Q130R, Q130K, Q130E, or Q130A mutation by introducing the desired mutations into the infectious cDNA clone and rescuing the mutant viruses. To investigate the biological properties of the mutant viruses, we first examined the growth kinetics of the rescued viruses. As shown in Fig. 6C , all mutant viruses had an accumulation of infectious virions and reached the highest titer at 60 h postinfection. Infection of the Q130R and Q130K mutant viruses resulted in growth curves similar to the growth curve for the WT (Fig.  6C) , while the Q130E and Q130A mutants produced smaller amounts of viruses between 24 and 60 h. Analysis of the plaque morphology revealed that the plaques of the Q130R, Q130K, and Q130E mutants were similar to the plaques of the WT, whereas the plaques of the Q130A mutant were smaller than those of the WT.\\n\\nWe next investigated the sensitivity of the four mutant viruses to manidipine. As shown in Fig. 6D , the Q130R and Q130K mutant viruses were resistant to manidipine. At a 10 M concentration, manidipine efficiently inhibited WT JEV infection and reduced the viral yields by approximately 4 log units, while the Q130R and Q130K mutant viruses were resistant to manidipine and the viral titer decreased less than 2 log units. The Q130A mutant virus demonstrated moderate resistance and a slightly higher Taken together, it could be concluded that Q130 not only is critical for conferring manidipine sensitivity but also is important for JEV replication. The replacement of glutamine with basic amino acids conferred resistance to manidipine without an apparent loss of growth.\\n\\nIn vivo efficacy of manidipine. As manidipine exhibited the strongest inhibitory activities on JEV replication as well as ZIKV infection when its activities were compared with those of the five hit drugs (Fig. 2 and 4A) , we further examined the protective effect of manidipine against JEV-induced lethality in a mouse model. As anticipated, mice in the JEV-infected vehicle-treated group started to show symptoms, including limb paralysis, restriction of movement, piloerection, body stiffening, and whole-body tremor, from day 5 postinfection. Within 21 days postinfection, most mice in the JEV-infected group succumbed to the infection, with the mortality rate being 73% (4 out of 15 animals survived). Manidipine treatment following JEV infection reduced the mortality rate to 20% (12 out of 15 animals survived) (Fig. 7A ). Mice treated with manidipine alone or treated with manidipine and infected with JEV showed little abnormal behavior, similar to the findings for the mice in the vehicle-treated group. These results suggest that manidipine provided effective protection against JEVinduced mortality.\\n\\nTo further relate these protective effects to the viral load and histopathological changes in the mouse brains, the viral titer was determined and mouse brain sections were collected and assayed at day 5 and day 21 postinfection, since mice started to show symptoms of JEV infection from day 5 postinfection and most of the surviving mice had recovered at day 21. The results indicated that, during the progression of the disease, manidipine treatment significantly reduced the viral load in infected mice compared to that in infected mice not receiving treatment, while no plaques formed in either the manidipine-or vehicle-treated group, and viral loads were undetectable in each group on day 21 postinfection (Fig. 7B) . As JEV was rapidly cleared from the blood after inoculation and was present in the lymphatic system during the preclinical phase, the effects of manidipine on infection of serum and the spleen were evaluated at earlier time points to detect whether the drug reduced the peripheral viral loads (20, 21) . As shown in Fig. 7C , manidipine had little effect on peripheral JEV infection, which indicated that manidipine protected the mice against JEV-induced lethality by decreasing the viral load in the brain. Similarly, apparent damage in the brain, including meningitis, perivascular cuffing, vacuolar degeneration, and glial nodules, was observed in the JEV-infected and vehicle-treated group on day 5 postinfection, while manidipine treatment remarkably alleviated these phenomena (Fig. 7D) . These results indicate that the alleviation of histopathological changes was accompanied by a reduction in the viral load as well as a reduction in the rate of mortality, further confirming the curative effects of manidipine on viral encephalitis.\\n\\nAmong the five hit drugs, manidipine, cilnidipine, and benidipine hydrochloride were VGCC inhibitors. It has been well documented in the literature that Ca 2ϩ inhibitors serve to inhibit virus infection at the stage of either entry (15, 22) or replication (18) and even at the stage of budding (23) . To this end, we first reviewed all 21 calcium inhibitors included in the current library of FDA-approved drugs and found that, in addition to the four DHP VGCC inhibitors listed in Fig. 1B , two other calcium inhibitors, i.e., flunarizine dihydrochloride and lomerizine hydrochloride, were also identified to be primary candidates with levels of inhibition of Ͼ90%. Similarly, three calcium channel antagonists, nisoldipine, felodipine, and nicardipine hydrochloride, showed levels of inhibition of 75%, 72%, and 66%, respectively, in the primary screen. Together, 9 of the 21 calcium inhibitors in the library, accounting for nearly half of the calcium inhibitors, exhibited levels of flavivirus inhibition of greater than 50%, suggesting that calcium, especially the calcium channel, is a potential antiviral target. To address this, another type of VGCC inhibitor, verapamil, an FDA-approved drug not yet included in the drug library used in this study, was investigated. Likewise, a Ca 2ϩ chelator, BAPTA-AM, as well as the Ca 2ϩ inhibitors 2-APB and cyclosporine, targeting ER and the mitochondrial Ca 2ϩ channel, respectively, were employed to investigate the response of JEV infection to the decrease in intracellular Ca 2ϩ levels. In line with the activities of the three hit DHP VGCC inhibitor drugs, the additional Ca 2ϩ inhibitors exerted anti-JEV activity, which indicated that Ca 2ϩ is indispensable for JEV infection. Thus, Ca 2ϩ inhibitors might be utilized as effective treatments for flavivirus infection.\\n\\nAs the hit drugs exerted full inhibitory activity when they were added posttreatment, we believe that Ca 2ϩ is important for flavivirus genome replication. Furthermore, selection and genetic analysis of drug-resistant viruses revealed that NS4B is the viral target of manidipine. NS4B is part of the viral replication complex and is supposed to anchor the viral replicase to the ER membrane (24) . Meanwhile, the N-terminal 125amino-acid domain of DENV NS4B was indicated to be responsible for inhibition of the immune response (25) . Notably, several structurally distinct compounds have been identified to inhibit flavivirus replication by intensively targeting the TMD of NS4B (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) . It is thus conceivable that inhibitors targeting TMD of NS4B would perturb its function, leading to the suppression of viral RNA replication. In this study, the replacement of Q130 of NS4B with a basic amino acid conferred the resistance effect without suppressing JEV replication, suggesting that position 130 could tolerate a basic amino acid and that the basic amino acid might be involved in the interplay of NS4B with host proteins rather than viral proteins.\\n\\nMoreover, the efficacy and toxicity of manidipine were monitored in vivo, with manidipine demonstrating effective antiviral activity with favorable biocompatibility. However, the dose used in this study was higher than the dose typically used clinically, representing one of the scenarios most commonly encountered in drug repurposing (33, 34) . As manidipine was approved for use for the long-term treatment of hypertension (35, 36) , pulse-dose treatment with manidipine over the shorter period of time required for the treatment of virus infection might be relatively safe. Moreover, use of a combination of manidipine with other Ca 2ϩ inhibitors might improve its therapeutic efficacy, reduce its toxicity, and reduce the risk of resistance development (37) (38) (39) .\\n\\nBesides the three VGCC inhibitors, two hit drugs, pimecrolimus and nelfinavir mesylate, showed equivalent inhibitory activities on the replication of JEV, ZIKV, WNV, and DENV-2. Although there has been no report on the use of pimecrolimus for the treatment of infectious diseases, we showed that it had a robust effect against JEV with an SI of Ͼ32. The maximum plasma concentration (C max ) of nelfinavir mesylate achieved with an adult dose was 3 to 4 g/ml (40) , which was comparable to the IC 50 reported here. Notably, nelfinavir mesylate was confirmed to inhibit herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and the replication of several other herpesviruses by interfering directly or indirectly with the later steps of virus formation, such as glycoprotein maturation or virion release, other than functioning in herpesviruses protease (41, 42) . Whether nelfinavir mesylate inhibits flavivirus by interference with the virus protease or by other off-target effects is unknown. Understanding of the mechanism of the antiflavivirus effects of these drugs might uncover novel targets of the drugs, providing further insight into the pathogenesis of flaviviruses.\\n\\nAbove all, the findings reported here provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying flavivirus infection and offer new and promising therapeutic possibilities for combating infections caused by flaviviruses.\\n\\nCells and viruses. BHK-21, SH-SY5Y (human neuroblastoma), Vero, and Huh-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (HyClone, Logan, UT, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA). JEV strain AT31, the WNV replicon, and the DENV-2 replicon expressing Renilla luciferase (Rluc) were kindly provided by Bo Zhang, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), China. JEV replicon recombinant viral particles (RVPs) were generated as previously described (4, 5) . ZIKV strain H/PF/2013, kindly provided by the European Virus Archive Goes Global, was propagated and titrated in Vero cells.\\n\\nOptimization of HTS assay conditions. The cell density and RVP dose were optimized for the HTS assay. Vero cells at different densities (2,500 to 12,500 cells per well) were infected with from 1.25 to 20 l RVPs (1 to 16 copies per well). The appropriate cell density as well as the RVP dose was selected by comparing the S/B ratio, CV, and Z= values under different conditions as previously described (43) . Methyl-␤-cyclodextrin and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were used as positive and negative controls, respectively.\\n\\nHTS assay of an FDA-approved compound library. A library of 1,018 FDA-approved drugs was purchased from Selleck Chemicals (Houston, TX, USA). The compounds were stored as 10 mM stock solutions in DMSO at 4°C until use. The first round of the HTS assay was carried out as shown in Fig. 1A . The criteria used to identify the primary candidates were no apparent cytotoxicity and an average level of inhibition of Ͼ90% in duplicate wells. The criteria of dose-dependent inhibition and cell viability of Ͼ80% were applied for the reconfirmation screen. Furthermore, the CC 50 of each compound was calculated, and those compounds displaying SIs over 10 were considered hits in this study.\\n\\nIdentification of antiviral effects of five hit drugs. The antiviral effects of the drugs were evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR), immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and plaque assay as previously reported (44) (45) (46) (47) . The experimental timeline is depicted in Fig. 2A .\\n\\nTo ensure the effectiveness of the hit drugs in flavivirus replication, BHK-21 cells transfected with the JEV, WNV, or DENV-2 replicon were incubated with each drug at the concentrations indicated above, and the luciferase activities were determined 24 h, 48 h, or 72 h later, respectively.\\n\\nTime-of-addition experiment. To evaluate which stage of the JEV life cycle was inhibited by each hit, a time-of-addition experiment was performed as previously described (43) . Vero cells were infected with 20 l RVPs for 1 h (0 to 1 h). The test compounds were incubated with the cells for 1 h before infection (Ϫ1 to 0 h), during infection (0 to 1 h), and for 23 h postinfection (1 to 24 h) (Fig. 3A) . To exclude a possible direct inactivating effect of the drugs, RVPs were incubated with each drug at 37°C for 1 h, and the mixtures were diluted 25-fold to infect Vero cells. Twenty-four hours later, the luciferase activities were determined as described above (Fig. 3A) .\\n\\nManidipine-resistant virus. Manidipine-resistant virus was generated by passaging of JEV on Vero cells in the presence of manidipine. Passages 1 to 10 used 5 M manidipine, and passages 11 to 20 used 10 M manidipine. As a control, WT virus was passaged in the presence of 2% DMSO in parallel. Passaging was terminated at passage 20, when no further improvement in resistance was detected. Two manidipine-resistant virus isolates were plaque purified and amplified in the presence of manidipine. Viral RNA was extracted, amplified, and purified for sequencing. An infectious cDNA clone of JEV, strain AT31 (pMWJEAT), kindly provided by T. Wakita, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute for Neuroscience, was used to recover WT and mutant viruses as described previously (4) . Virus titers and manidipine sensitivities were determined by plaque assay in Vero cells.\\n\\nManidipine administration to JEV-infected mice. Adult female BALB/c mice (age, 4 weeks) were kept in the Laboratory Animal Center of Wuhan Institute of Virology, CAS (Wuhan, China). The mice were randomly divided into four groups (30 mice per group): a JEV-infected and vehicle (2% Tween 80 plus 5% DMSO in phosphate-buffered saline [PBS])-treated group, a manidipine-treated group, a JEV-infected and manidipine-treated group, and a vehicle-treated group. For infection, mice were infected intraperitoneally with 5 ϫ 10 6 PFU of JEV strain AT31. For the manidipine and vehicle treatments, mice were injected intraperitoneally with 25 mg/kg of body weight manidipine or PBS with 2% Tween 80 and 5% DMSO, respectively. Treatments were administered twice a day for the first 2 days and then consecutively administered once a day for up to 21 days. Five mice from each group were sacrificed on days 1, 3, and 5 postinfection. Serum, spleen tissue, and brain tissue samples were collected for viral titer determination and histopathology investigation. Fifteen mice were monitored daily for morbidity and mortality. The mice that showed neurological signs of disease were euthanized according to the Regulations for the Administration of Affairs Concerning Experimental Animals in China. The protocols were reviewed and approved by the Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, CAS (Wuhan, China).'}}>,\n",

Although apparently disadvantaged by their dependence on the host biosynthetic processes, an immensely faster rate of evolution provides viruses with an edge in this conflict. In this review, I have discussed the potential anti-virus activity of inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), a well characterized effector of the cellular homeostatic response to an overloading of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein-folding capacity. IRE1, an ER-membrane-resident ribonuclease (RNase), upon activation catalyses regulated cleavage of select protein-coding and non-coding host RNAs, using an RNase domain which is homologous to that of the known anti-viral effector RNaseL. The latter operates as part of the Oligoadenylate synthetase OAS/RNaseL system of anti-viral defense mechanism. Protein-coding RNA substrates are differentially treated by the IRE1 RNase to either augment, through cytoplasmic splicing of an intron in the Xbp1 transcript, or suppress gene expression. This referred suppression of gene expression is mediated through degradative cleavage of a select cohort of cellular RNA transcripts, initiating the regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD) pathway. The review first discusses the anti-viral mechanism of the OAS/RNaseL system and evasion tactics employed by different viruses. This is followed by a review of the RIDD pathway and its potential effect on the stability of viral RNAs. I conclude with a comparison of the enzymatic activity of the two RNases followed by deliberations on the physiological consequences of their activation.\\n\\nText: Establishment of infection by a virus, even in permissive host cells, is beset with a plethora of challenges from innate-antiviral and cell-death pathways. Therefore, the host response to a virus infection might prove to be inhibitory for the viral life cycle in a direct or an indirect manner. The direct mechanism involves expression of multiple anti-viral genes that have evolved to recognize, react, and thereby rid the infected host of the viral nucleic acid (Zhou et al., 1997; Thompson et al., 2011) . On the other hand the pathways, e.g., those that culminate in initiating an apoptotic death for the host cell, indirectly serve to limit the spread of virus (Roulston et al., 1999) . A major difference between these two mechanisms is that while the former response is transmissible to neighboring uninfected cells through interferon (IFN) signaling, the latter is observed mostly in cis. Recent reports, however, have demonstrated transmission of an apoptotic signal between cells that are in contact through gap junctions, although such a signaling from an virus infected host cell to an uninfected one is not known yet (Cusato et al., 2003; Udawatte and Ripps, 2005; Kameritsch et al., 2013) . Successful viral pathogens, through a process of active selection, have evolved to replicate and simultaneously evade or block either of these host responses. The viral nucleic acids which could be the genome (positive-sense singlestranded RNA virus) or RNA derived from transcription of the genome [negative-stranded single-sense RNA or double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) or DNA virus], offer critical targets for both detection and eradication. The viral nucleic acid targeting armaments in the host arsenal include those that recognize the associated molecular patterns like toll-like receptors (TLRs), DDX58 (or RIG-1), IFIH1 (or MDA5), IFIT proteins [IFN-stimulated genes (ISG)56 and ISF54], etc. (Aoshi et al., 2011; Bowzard et al., 2011; Jensen and Thomsen, 2012) . This is followed by IFN signaling and expression or activation of factors that target the inducer for degradation or modification like OAS/ribonuclease L (RNaseL) system, APOBEC3, MCPIP1, the ZC3HAV1/exosome system and RNAi pathways (Gao et al., 2002; Sheehy et al., 2002; Guo et al., 2007; Daffis et al., 2010; Sidahmed and Wilkie, 2010; Schmidt et al., 2012; Cho et al., 2013a; Lin et al., 2013) . In this review we focus on two proteins containing homologous RNase domains, RNaseL with a known direct antiviral function and Inositolrequiring enzyme 1 (IRE1 or ERN1) which has an RNaseL-like RNase domain with a known role in homeostatic response to unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and a potential to function as an antiviral (Figure 1 ; Tirasophon et al., 2000) .\\n\\nIn mammalian cells the tell-tale signs of RNA virus infection, like the presence of cytosolic RNA having 5 -ppp or extensive (>30 bp) dsRNA segments are detected by dedicated pathogen associated molecular pattern receptors (PAMPs) or pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in the host cell, like RIG-1, MDA5, and the IFIT family of proteins (Aoshi et al., 2011; Bowzard et al., 2011; Vabret and Blander, 2013) . The transduction of a signal of this recognition results in the expression of IFN genes the products www.frontiersin.org FIGURE 1 | Schematic representation of the ribonuclease activity of IRE1 and RNaseL showing cross-talk between the paths catalysed by the enzymes. The figure shows activation of RNase activity following dimerization triggered by either accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER-lumen or synthesis of 2-5A by the enzyme OAS, respectively, for IRE1 and RNaseL. The cleavage of Xbp1u by IRE1 releases an intron thus generating Xbp1s. The IRE1 targets in RIDD pathway or all RNaseL substrates are shown to undergo degradative cleavage. The cleavage products generated through degradation of the respective substrate is shown to potentially interact with RIG-I thereby leading to Interferon secretion and trans-activation of Oas genes through Interferon signaling. Abbreviations: RIG-I = retinoic acid inducible gene-I, Ifnb = interferon beta gene loci, IFN = interferons, ISG = interferon-sensitive genes, 2-5A = 2 -5 oligoadenylates.\\n\\nof which upon secretion outside the cell bind to cognate receptors, initiating further downstream signaling (Figure 1 ; Randall and Goodbourn, 2008) . The genes that are regulated as a result of IFN signaling are termed as IFN-stimulated or IFN-regulated genes (ISGs or IRGs; Sen and Sarkar, 2007; Schoggins and Rice, 2011) . Oligoadenylate synthetase or OAS genes are canonical ISGs that convert ATP into 2 -5 linked oligoadenylates (2-5A) by an unique enzymatic mechanism (Figure 1 ; Hartmann et al., 2003) . Further, they are RNA-binding proteins that function like PRRs, in a way that the 2-5A synthesizing activity needs to be induced through an interaction with dsRNA (Minks et al., 1979; Hartmann et al., 2003) . In a host cell infected by an RNA virus, such dsRNA is present in the form of replication-intermediates (RI), which are synthesized by the virus-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) and subsequently used by the same enzyme to synthesize more genomic RNA, through asymmetric transcription (Weber et al., 2006) . However, the replications complexes (RCs) harboring these RI molecules are found secluded inside host-membrane derived vesicles, at least in positive-strand RNA viruses, a group which contains many human pathogens (Uchil and Satchidanandam, 2003; Denison, 2008) . Reports from different groups suggest OAS proteins to be distributed both in the cytoplasm as well as in membrane-associated fractions, perhaps indicating an evolution of the host anti-viral methodologies towards detection of the membrane-associated viral dsRNAs (Marie et al., 1990; Lin et al., 2009) . DNA viruses on the other hand, produce dsRNA by annealing of RNA derived from transcription of both strands in the same viral genomic loci, which are probably detected by the cytoplasmic pool of OAS proteins (Jacobs and Langland, 1996; Weber et al., 2006) . Post-activation the OAS enzymes synthesize 2-5A molecules in a non-processive reaction producing oligomers which, although potentially ranging in size from dimeric to multimeric, are functionally active only in a trimeric or tetrameric form (Dong et al., 1994; Sarkar et al., 1999; Silverman, 2007) . These small ligands, which bear phosphate groups (1-3) at the 5 end and hydroxyl groups at the 2 and 3 positions, serve as co-factor which can specifically interact with and thereby allosterically activate, existing RNaseL molecules (Knight et al., 1980; Zhou et al., 1997 Zhou et al., , 2005 Sarkar et al., 1999) . As part of a physiological control system these 2-5A oligomers are quite unstable in that they are highly susceptible to degradation by cellular 5 -phosphatases and PDE12 (2 -phosphodiesterase; Silverman et al., 1981; Johnston and Hearl, 1987; Kubota et al., 2004; Schmidt et al., 2012) . Viral strategies to evade or overcome this host defense mechanism ranges from preventing IFN signaling which would hinder the induction of OAS expression or thwarting activation of expressed OAS proteins by either shielding the viral dsRNA from interacting with it or modulating the host pathway to synthesize inactive 2-5A derivatives (Cayley et al., 1984; Hersh et al., 1984; Rice et al., 1985; Maitra et al., 1994; Beattie et al., 1995; Rivas et al., 1998; Child et al., 2004; Min and Krug, 2006; Sanchez and Mohr, 2007; Sorgeloos et al., 2013) . Shielding of viral RNA from interacting with OAS is possible through enclosure of dsRNA replication intermediates in membrane enclosed compartments as observed in many flaviviruses (Ahlquist, 2006; Miller and Krijnse-Locker, 2008; Miorin et al., 2013) .\\n\\nRNaseL is a 741 amino acid protein containing three predominantly structured region, an N-terminal ankyrin repeat domain (ARD), a middle catalytically inactive pseudo-kinase (PK) and a C-terminal RNase domain (Figure 2A ; Hassel et al., 1993; Zhou et al., 1993) . The activity of the RNase domain is negatively regulated by the ARD, which is relieved upon binding of 2-5A molecules to ankyrin repeats 2 and 4 followed by a conformational alteration (Figure 1 ; Hassel et al., 1993; Tanaka et al., 2004; Nakanishi et al., 2005) . In support of this contention, deletion of the ARD has been demonstrated to produce constitutively active RNaseL, although with dramatically lower RNase activity (Dong and Silverman, 1997) . However, recent reports suggest that while 2-5A links the ankyrin repeats from adjacent molecules leading to formation of dimer and higher order structures, at sufficiently high in vitro concentrations, RNaseL could oligomerize even in the absence of 2-5A . Nonetheless, in vivo the RNaseL nuclease activity still seems to be under the sole regulation of 2-5A (Al-Saif and Khabar, 2012) . In order to exploit this dependence, multiple viruses like mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and rotavirus group A (RVA) have evolved to encode phosphodiesterases capable of hydrolysing the 2 -5 linkages in 2-5A and thereby attenuate the RNaseL cleavage activity (Zhao et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2013) . In addition to 5 -phosphatases and 2 -phosphodiesterases to reduce ClustalW alignment of primary sequence from a segment of the PK domain indicating amino acid residues which are important for interacting with nucleotide cofactors. The conserved lysine residues, critical for this interaction (K599 for IRE1 and K392 in RNaseL) are underlined. (C) Alignment of the KEN domains in RNaseL and IRE1. The amino acids highlighted and numbered in IRE1 are critical for the IRE1 RNase activity (Tirasophon et al., 2000) .\\n\\nthe endogenous 2-5A levels, mammalian genomes encode posttranscriptional and post-translation inhibitors of RNaseL activity in the form of microRNA-29 and the protein ABCE1 (RNaseL inhibitor or RLI), respectively (Bisbal et al., 1995; Lee et al., 2013) . Direct inhibition of RNaseL function is also observed upon infection by Picornaviruses through, either inducing the expression of ABCE1 or exercising a unique inhibitory property of a segment of the viral RNA (Martinand et al., 1998 (Martinand et al., , 1999 Townsend et al., 2008; Sorgeloos et al., 2013) .\\n\\nOnce activated by 2-5A, RNaseL can degrade single-stranded RNA irrespective of its origin (virus or host) although there seems to exist a bias towards cleavage of viral RNA (Wreschner et al., 1981a; Silverman et al., 1983; Li et al., 1998) . RNA sequences that are predominantly cleaved by RNaseL are U-rich with the cleavage points being typically at the 3 end of UA or UG or UU di-nucleotides, leaving a 5 -OH and a 3 -monophosphate in the cleavage product (Floyd-Smith et al., 1981; Wreschner et al., 1981b) . A recent report shows a more general consensus of 5 -UNN-3 with the cleavage point between the second and the third nucleotide (Han et al., 2014) . Cellular targets of RNaseL include both ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and mRNAs, the latter predominantly representing genes involved in protein biosynthesis (Wreschner et al., 1981a; Al-Ahmadi et al., 2009; Andersen et al., 2009) . Additionally, RNaseL activity can also degrade specific ISG mRNA transcripts and thereby attenuate the effect of IFN signaling (Li et al., 2000) . Probably an evolution towards insulating gene expression from RNaseL activity is observed in the coding region of mammalian genes where the UU/UA dinucleotide frequency is rarer (Bisbal et al., 2000; Khabar et al., 2003; Al-Saif and Khabar, 2012) . Perhaps not surprisingly, with a much faster rate of evolution, similar observations have been made with respect to evasion of RNaseL mediated degradation by viral RNAs too (Han and Barton, 2002; Washenberger et al., 2007) . Moreover, nucleoside modifications in host mRNAs, rarely observed in viral RNAs, have also been shown to confer protection from RNaseL (Anderson et al., 2011) . In addition to directly targeting viral RNA, the reduction in functional ribosomes and ribosomal protein mRNA affects viral protein synthesis and replication in an indirect manner. Probably, as a reflection of these effects on cellular RNAs, RNaseL is implicated as one of the factors determining the anti-proliferative effect of IFN activity . The anti-viral activity of RNaseL extends beyond direct cleavage of viral RNA, through stimulation of RIG-I by the cleavage product (Malathi et al., , 2007 (Malathi et al., , 2010 . A global effect of RNaseL is observed in the form of autophagy induced through c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling and apoptosis, probably as a consequence of rRNA cleavage (Li et al., 2004; Chakrabarti et al., 2012; Siddiqui and Malathi, 2012) . RNaseL has also been demonstrated to play a role in apoptotic cell death initiated by pharmacological agents extending the physiological role of this pathway beyond the boundary of being only an anti-viral mechanism (Castelli et al., 1997 (Castelli et al., , 1998 .\\n\\nThe ER serves as a conduit for maturation of cellular proteins which are either secreted or destined to be associated with a membrane for its function. An exclusive microenvironment (high Calcium ion and unique ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione) along with a battery of ER-lumen resident enzymes (foldases, chaperones, and lectins) catalyse/mediate the necessary folding, disulfide-bond formation, and glycosylation reactions (Schroder and Kaufman, 2005) . A perturbation of the folding capacity, due to either physiological disturbances or virus infection, can lead to an accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER lumen, which signals an unfolded protein response (UPR). UPR encompasses a networked transcriptional and translational gene-expression program, initiated by three ER-membrane resident sensors namely IRE1 or ERN1, PKR-like ER Kinase (PERK or EIF2AK3) and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6; Hetz, 2012) . IRE1 is a type I single-pass trans-membrane protein in which, similar to what is observed with RNaseL, the N-terminal resident in the ER lumen serves as sensor and the cytosolic C-terminal as the effector (Figure 1 ; Chen and Brandizzi, 2013) . The IRE1 coding gene is present in genomes ranging from yeast to mammals and in the latter is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues (Tirasophon et al., 1998) . Signal transduction by stimulated IRE1 initiates multiple gene regulatory pathways with either pro-survival or pro-apoptotic consequences (Kaufman, 1999) . During homeostasis or unstressed conditions the sensor molecules are monomeric, a state maintained co-operatively by the \" absence\" of unfolded proteins and the \"presence\" of HSPA5 (GRP78 or Bip, an ERresident chaperone) molecules bound to a membrane-proximal disordered segment of the protein in the ER-lumen-resident Nterminus (Credle et al., 2005) . Accumulated unfolded proteins in the lumen triggers coupling of this domain from adjacent sensor molecules through a combination of (a) titration of the bound HSPA5 chaperone molecules and (b) direct tethering by malfolded protein molecules (Shamu and Walter, 1996; Credle et al., 2005; Aragon et al., 2009; Korennykh et al., 2009) . Abutting of the luminal domains juxtapose the cytosolic C-terminal segments, leading to an aggregation of the IRE1 molecules into distinct ER-membrane foci (Kimata et al., 2007; Li et al., 2010) . The C-terminal segment has a serine/threonine kinase domain and a RNase domain homologous to that of RNaseL (Figure 1 ; Tirasophon et al., 1998 Tirasophon et al., , 2000 . A trans-autophosphorylation by the kinase domain allosterically activates the RNase domain (Tirasophon et al., 2000; Lee et al., 2008; Korennykh et al., 2009) . In fact, exogenous over-expression of IRE1 in mammalian cells lead to activation suggesting that, under homeostatic conditions, the non-juxtaposition of cytosolic domains maintains an inactive IRE1 (Tirasophon et al., 1998) . Once activated, IRE1 performs cleavage of a variety of RNA substrates mediated by its RNase domain, in addition to phosphorylating and thereby activating JNK (Cox and Walter, 1996; Urano et al., 2000) . Depending on the RNA substrate, the cleavage catalyzed by IRE1 RNase produces differential consequence. Although scission of the Xbp1 mRNA transcript at two internal positions is followed by splicing of the internal segment through ligation of the terminal cleavage products, that in all other known IRE1 target RNA is followed by degradation (Figure 1 ; Sidrauski and Walter, 1997; Calfon et al., 2002) . The latter mode of negative regulation of gene expression is termed as the regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD) pathway (Hollien and Weissman, 2006; Oikawa et al., 2007; Iqbal et al., 2008; Lipson et al., 2008) . Gene transcripts regulated by RIDD pathway includes that from IRE1 (i.e., selftranscripts), probably in a negative feedback loop mechanism (Tirasophon et al., 2000) . In addition to protein coding RNA, RIDD pathway down-regulates the level of a host of microRNA precursors (pre-miRNAs) and can potentially cleave in the anticodon loop of tRNA Phe (Korennykh et al., 2011; Upton et al., 2012) .\\n\\nThe IRE1 RNase domain cleaves the Xbp1u (u for unspliced) mRNA transcript at two precise internal positions within the open reading frame (ORF) generating three segments, the terminal two of which are ligated by a tRNA ligase in yeast and by an unknown ligase in mammalian cells, to produce the Xbp1s (s for spliced) mRNA transcript (Figure 1 ; Yoshida et al., 2001) . The Xbp1s thus generated has a longer ORF, which is created by a frame-shift in the coding sequence downstream of the splice site (Cox and Walter, 1996; Calfon et al., 2002) . A similar dual endonucleolytic cleavage is also observed to initiate the XRN1 and Ski2-3-8 dependent degradation of transcripts in the RIDD degradation pathway (Hollien and Weissman, 2006) . The RIDD target transcript genes are predominantly those that encode membrane-associated or secretory proteins and which are not necessary for ER proteinfolding reactions (Hollien and Weissman, 2006) . The cleavage of Xbp1 and the RIDD-target transcripts constitute homeostatic or pro-survival response by IRE1 since XBP1S trans-activates genes encoding multiple chaperones (to fold unfolded proteins) and the ERAD pathway genes (to degrade terminally misfolded proteins) whereas RIDD reduces flux of polypeptides entering the ER lumen (Lee et al., 2003; Hollien and Weissman, 2006) . On the other hand, cleavage of pre-miRNA transcripts which are processed in the cell to generate CASPASE-2 mRNA (Casp2) controlling miRNAs, constitutes the pro-apoptotic function of IRE1 (Upton et al., 2012) . Another pro-apoptotic signal from IRE1 emanates from signaling through phosphorylation of JNK1 (Urano et al., 2000) . Although in the initial phase RIDD activity does not cleave mRNAs encoding essential ER proteins, at later stages of chronic UPR such transcripts are rendered susceptible to degradation promoting apoptosis induction (Han et al., 2009; Bhattacharyya et al., 2014) .\\n\\nInfection of mammalian cells by a multitude of viruses induce an UPR which is sometimes characterized by suppression of signaling by one or more of the three sensor(s; Su et al., 2002; Tardif et al., 2002; He, 2006; Yu et al., 2006 Yu et al., , 2013 Medigeshi et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2010; Merquiol et al., 2011) . Among these at least two viruses from diverse families, HCMV (a DNA virus) and hepatitis C virus (a hepacivirus), interfere with IRE1 signaling by different mechanism (Tardif et al., 2004; Stahl et al., 2013 ). An observed inhibition of any cellular function by a virus infection could suggest a potential anti-virus function for it, which the virus has evolved to evade through blocking some critical step(s). In both the cases mentioned above, stability of the viral proteins seems to be affected by ERAD-mediated degradation, although other potential anti-viral effect of IRE1 activation are not clear yet (Isler et al., 2005; Saeed et al., 2011) . Interestingly, host mRNA fragments produced following IRE1 activation during bacterial infection, has been shown to activate RIG-I signaling (Figure 1 ; Cho et al., 2013b) . Theoretically, other functions of IRE1 can also have anti-viral effect necessitating its inhibition for uninhibited viral replication. It is, however, still not clear whether IRE1 is able to cleave any viral RNA (or mRNA) in a manner similar to that of other RIDD targets (Figure 1) . The possibilities of such a direct anti-viral function are encouraged by the fact that all these viruses encode at least one protein which, as part of its maturation process, requires glycosylation and disulfide-bond formation. Such a necessity would entail translation of the mRNA encoding such a protein, which in case of positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses would mean the genome, in association with the ER-membrane (Figure 1 ; Lerner et al., 2003) . Additionally for many RNA viruses, replication complexes are housed in ER-derived vesicular structures (Denison, 2008; den Boon et al., 2010) . Considering the proximity of IRE1 and these virus-derived RNAs it is tempting to speculate that probably at some point of time in the viral life cycle one or more virus-associated RNA would be susceptible to cleavage by IRE1. However, studies with at least two viruses have shown that instead of increasing viral titre, inhibiting the RNase activity of activated IRE1 has an opposite effect (Hassan et al., 2012; Bhattacharyya et al., 2014) . This implies potential benefits of IRE1 activation through one or more of the following, (a) expression of chaperones or other pro-viral molecules downstream of XBP1Supregulation or JNK-activation, (b) cleavage of potential anti-viral gene mRNA transcripts by RIDD activity. However, the mode of protection for the viral RNA from RIDD activity is still not clear. It is possible that the viral proteins create a subdomain within the ER membrane, which through some mechanism excludes IRE1 from diffusing near the genomic RNA, thereby protecting the replication complexes (Denison, 2008) . It is therefore probably not surprising that single-stranded plus-sense RNA viruses encode a polyprotein, which produces replication complexes in cis, promoting formation of such subdomains (Egger et al., 2000) . The fact that IRE1 forms bulky oligomers of higher order probably aggravates such an exclusion of the activated sensor molecules from vicinity of the viral replication complexes. The UPR signaling eventually attenuate during chronic ER-stress and since that is what a virus-induced UPR mimics, probably the viral RNA needs protection only during the initial phase of UPR activation (Lin et al., 2007) . Since the choice of RIDD target seems to be grossly driven towards mRNAs that encode ER-transitory but are not ER-essential proteins, it is also possible that one or more viral protein have evolved to mimic a host protein the transcript of which is RIDD-resistant (Hollien and Weissman, 2006) . Most of the RIDD target mRNA are observed to be ER-membrane associated, the proximity to IRE1 facilitating association and cleavage (Figure 1 ; Hollien and Weissman, 2006) . Although ER-association for an mRNA is possible without the mediation of ribosomes, Gaddam and co-workers reported that continued association with polysomes for a membrane-bound mRNA can confer protection from IRE1 cleavage (Cui et al., 2012; Gaddam et al., 2013) . This would suggest important implications for the observed refractory nature of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and influenza virus RNA to RIDD cleavage (Hassan et al., 2012; Bhattacharyya et al., 2014) . In contrast to Influenza virus, flaviviruses (which include JEV) do not suppress host protein synthesis implying the absence of a global inhibition on translation as would be expected during UPR (Clyde et al., 2006; Edgil et al., 2006) . Therefore, a continued translation of viral RNA in spite of UPR activation can in principle confer protection from the pattern of RNA cleavage observed in the RIDD pathway.\\n\\nIRE1 and RNaseL, in addition to biochemical similarities in protein kinase domain and structural similarities in their RNase domain, share the functional consequences of their activation in initiating cellular apoptosis through JNK signaling (Table 1 and Figure 2 ; Liu and Lin, 2005; Dhanasekaran and Reddy, 2008) . Though initial discoveries were made in the context of homeostatic and anti-viral role for the former and latter, differences between the pathways are narrowed by further advances in research. In the same vein, while inhibition of IRE1 signaling in virus infected cells indicates a potential anti-viral role, www.frontiersin.org (Tirasophon et al., 1998; Dong and Silverman, 1999; Papa et al., 2003; Lin et al., 2007) Nature of RNase substrates Both 28S rRNA and mRNAs IRE1β can cleave both 28S rRNA and mRNA while IRE1α substrates include only mRNAs (Iwawaki et al., 2001) Dissimilarities\\n\\nCleavage substrates Beside 28S rRNA, predominantly cleaves mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins (Andersen et al., 2009) Xbp1u and other mRNAs in addition to microRNA precursors which are targeted as part of the RIDD pathway Selection of cleavage site Cleaved between 2nd and 3rd nucleotide positions of UN/N sites (Han et al., 2014) RNA sequence with the consensus of 5 -CUGCAG-3 in association with a stem-loop (SL) structure essential for recognition of Xbp1u and other mRNAs (Oikawa et al., 2010) association of RNaseL mutations with generation of prostate cancer extends the ambit of influence of this anti-viral effector to more non-infectious physiological disorders (Silverman, 2003) . Biochemically, the similarity in their RNase domains does not extend to the choice of either substrates or cleavage point, which are downstream of UU or UA in RNaseL and downstream of G (predominantly) for IRE1 ( Figure 2C ; Yoshida et al., 2001; Hollien and Weissman, 2006; Upton et al., 2012) . Further, while RNaseL cleaves pre-dominantly in single-stranded region, IRE1 seems to cleave equally well in single-and double-stranded region (Upton et al., 2012) . However, a recent report suggested a consensus cleavage site with the sequence UN/N, in RNaseL targets and in those mRNAs that are cleaved by IRE1 as part of the RIDD pathway (Han et al., 2014) . Access to potential cleavage substrate for RNaseL is conjectured to be facilitated through its association with polyribosomes, while no such association is known for IRE1 (Salehzada et al., 1991) . Possibilities exist that IRE1 would have preferential distribution in the rough ER which, upon activation, would give it ready access to mRNAs for initiating the RIDD pathway.\\n\\nIn the context of a virus infection, the pathway leading from both these proteins have the potential to lead to cell death. Notwithstanding the fact that this might be an efficient way of virus clearance, it also portends pathological outcomes for the infected organism. Future research would probably lead to design of drugs targeting these proteins based on the structural homology of their effector domains, regulating the pathological denouement of their activation without compromising their anti-viral or potential anti-viral functions.'}}>,\n",

In this study, microRNA, mRNA and cytokine/chemokine secretion profiling were investigated for human monocyte-derived macrophages infected in-vitro with Influenza virus A/H1N1 and/or Streptococcus pneumoniae. We observed that the in-vitro co-infection synergistically increased interferon-γ-induced protein-10 (CXCL10, IP-10) expression compared to the singly-infected cells conditions. We demonstrated that endogenous miRNA-200a-3p, whose expression was synergistically induced following co-infection, indirectly regulates CXCL10 expression by targeting suppressor of cytokine signaling-6 (SOCS-6), a well-known regulator of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Additionally, in a subsequent clinical pilot study, immunomodulators levels were evaluated in samples from 74 children (≤5 years-old) hospitalized with viral and/or bacterial community-acquired pneumonia. Clinically, among the 74 cases of pneumonia, patients with identified mixed-detection had significantly higher (3.6-fold) serum IP-10 levels than those with a single detection (P = 0.03), and were significantly associated with severe pneumonia (P < 0.01). This study demonstrates that viral and bacterial co-infection modulates the JAK-STAT signaling pathway and leads to exacerbated IP-10 expression, which could play a major role in the pathogenesis of pneumonia.\\n\\nText: Scientific RepoRts | 6:38532 | DOI: 10 .1038/srep38532 pathogenesis of several diseases and has been suggested as a potential biomarker of viral infection 10, 11 , late-onset bacterial infection in premature infants 12 , and a promising biomarker of sepsis and septic shock 13, 14 . Combined analysis of IP-10 and IFN-γ has also been reported as a useful biomarker for diagnosis and monitoring therapeutic efficacy in patients with active tuberculosis [15] [16] [17] , and both remain detectable in the urine of patients with pulmonary diseases in the absence of renal dysfunction 18 .\\n\\nWith airway epithelial cells 19 , resident alveolar macrophages (AMs) and blood monocytes-derived macrophages (recruited into tissues under inflammatory conditions 20, 21 ) represent a major line of defense against both pneumococcal (through their high phagocytic capacity [22] [23] [24] ) and influenza infection 25, 26 . So far, no studies have yet focused on the intracellular mechanisms that regulate IP-10 in human blood leukocytes during mixed IAV and SP infection. Several studies indicated that host non-coding small RNAs (including microRNAs) may function as immunomodulators by regulating several pivotal intracellular processes, such as the innate immune response 27 and antiviral activity 28, 29 ; both of these processes are closely related to toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways.\\n\\nIn this study, we firstly investigated the in vitro intracellular mechanisms that mediate the innate immune response in IAV and/or SP infected human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). Using this approach, we observed that mixed-infection of MDMs induces a synergistic production of IP-10 which can be related to a miRNA-200a/JAK-STAT/SOCS-6 regulatory pathway. Subsequently, in a retrospective analysis of clinical samples collected from children ≤ 5 years-old hospitalized with pneumonia, we confirmed that serum IP-10 level could be related to both viral and/or bacterial etiologies and disease severity.\\n\\nCharacteristics of MDMs infected by IAV and/or SP. Initially, we investigated in vitro the impact of single and mixed IAV and SP infection on MDMs. Firstly, active replication of IAV was assessed by qRT-PCR and quantification of new infectious viral particles in the cell supernatants ( Fig. 1a,b ). IAV titer increased over time after single infection with IAV and correlated with increased production of negative-strand IAV RNA. Maximum viral replication was observed at 18-24 hours post-infection, after which time both RNA replication and the quantity of infectious particles decreased. In this in vitro model, subsequent challenge of IAV-infected MDMs with SP had no significant impact on the production of new infectious viral particles (Fig. 1b) . Together, these results indicate permissive and productive infection of MDMs by IAV. Secondly, we evaluated whether MDMs are permissive for both IAV and SP infection. The presence of pneumococci within IAV-and SP-infected primary MDMs was confirmed at 8 h post-infection (Fig. 1c) , suggesting that MDMs are permissive for viral and bacterial co-infection in the early steps of infection. Importantly, confocal co-detection of mixed IAV and SP was only effective following 8 h post-infection due to the bactericidal impact of SP internalization within human macrophages (after 24 h, data not shown). Thirdly, we evaluated the impact of single and mixed infection with IAV and SP on MDM viability. Mixed infection significantly decreased cell viability (65.2 ± 4.5% total cell death at 48 hours post-infection; P < 0.0001) compared to single SP and IAV infection (39.6 ± 1.7% and 17.4 ± 1.1% total cell death, respectively; Fig. 1d ). Taken together, these results confirmed human MDMs are permissive to mixed viral and bacterial infection. mRNA, microRNA and protein expression profiling reveal an overall induction of the host innate immune response following IAV and/or SP infection of MDMs. To investigate the innate immune response orchestrated by IAV-and SP-infected human MDMs, we firstly evaluated the expression of 84 genes involved in the innate and adaptive immune responses (Table S1) ; the major differentially-expressed genes are summarized in Fig. 2a . Expression profiling indicated an overall induction of genes related to the JAK-STAT, NF-Κ β and TLR signaling pathways. Indeed, all interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) screened, including CXCL10 (fold-change [FC] = 240.9), CCL-2 (FC = 34.2) and MX-1 (FC = 151.4) were upregulated following mixed infection compared to uninfected cells, most of which are closely related to STAT-1 (FC = 52.3), IRF-7 (FC = 6.8) and IFNB1 (FC = 5.2) also found upregulated in mixed infected cells. Secondly, we investigated the endogenous microRNA expression profiles of IAV-and SP-infected MDMs. A selection of microRNAs that were found to be differentially-expressed under different infection conditions are shown in Fig. 2b and Table S2 . MiRNA-200a-3p was overexpressed after both single IAV (FC = 6.9), single SP (FC = 3.7) and mixed IAV/SP infection (FC = 7.3), indicating this miRNA may play a role in the innate immune response to viral and bacterial co-infection. Similar miRNA-200a-3p dysregulation profiles were obtained following IAV and/or SP infections of human macrophages-like (THP-1 monocytes-derived macrophages) or primary MDMs (data not shown). Thirdly, the secreted levels of various antiviral, pro-inflammatory and immunomodulatory cytokines/chemokines were assayed in IAV-and SP-infected-THP-1 and primary MDM cell supernatants. We observed a remarkable correlation between the mRNA and protein expression profiles of single or mixed infected MDMs especially regarding CXCL-10 and IP-10 expression. Indeed, the level of IP-10 was synergistically increased in the supernatant of IAV-infected THP-1 MDMs exposed to SP (mean: 30,589 ± 16,484 pg ml −1 ) compared to single IAV infection (1,439 ± 566.5 pg ml −1 ) and single SP infection (4,472 ± 2,001 pg ml −1 ; P≤ 0.05; Fig. 2c ) at 24 hours after infection. In those cells, IP-10 expression reduced over time (48 to 72 hours), coinciding with a significant higher proportion of necrotic and apoptotic cells (Fig. 1d) . The synergistic expression of IP-10 was similarly observed at 24 hours post-infection using primary MDMs (Fig. 2d) . Significantly increased secretion of the other tested cytokines and chemokines was not observed post-infection, even in mixed infected MDMs (Fig. S1 ). Interestingly, a significant production of IP-10 was also observed in supernatants of primary human airway epithelial cells (HAEC) mixed-infected by IAV and SP compared to the single infections (Fig. 2e) . Taken together, the mRNA and protein profiling results suggested that mixed viral and bacterial infection of MDMs induces a synergistic pro-inflammatory response related to the type-1 interferon and JAK-STAT signaling pathways, with IP-10 as signature of IAV/SP co-infection. Among all microRNAs screened, miR-200a-3p was the most Scientific RepoRts | 6:38532 | DOI: 10.1038/srep38532 overexpressed in IAV/SP co-infection of human MDMs. In the remainder of this study, we decided to investigate the interconnection between miR-200a-3p expression and the innate immune response.\\n\\nEndogenous miRNA-200a-3p expression correlates with CXCL10 (IP-10) induction following mixed IAV and SP infection of human MDMs. Using a specific Taqman probe assay targeting miR-200a-3p, we confirmed a significant upregulation of miR-200a-3p following mixed IAV and SP infection of human MDMs (Fig. 3a) . In this experiment, a more marked up-regulation of miR-200a-3p was observed following IAV+ SP compared to results obtained previously (Fig. 2b) . This discrepancy has been attributed to the use of two different approaches to quantify miR-200a-3p expression. The use of a target-specific stem-loop reverse transcription primer in Fig. 3a allows a better sensitivity of miR-200a-3p detection compared to the non-specific fluorescent dye used in Fig. 2b . As the general trend was suggestive of a synergistic induction of miR-200a-3p in response to mixed infection (Fig. 3a) , we hypothesized microRNA-200a-3p may play a role in the regulation of CXCL10 (IP-10), which was also synergistically upregulated in mixed-infected MDMs ( Fig. 2c and d) and primary HAEC ( Statistical analyses were performed using two-way ANOVA with Tukey\\'s post-hoc test; *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001.\\n\\nScientific RepoRts | 6:38532 | DOI: 10.1038/srep38532 CXCL10 (Fig. 3d) . These results suggested miR-200a-3p indirectly regulates CXCL10 and led us to hypothesize that miR-200a-3p controls a potential repressor of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. . At 18 h after transfection, the MDMs were singly or mixed infected as described previously. At 8 h post-IAV and/or SP infection, total mRNA was extracted and amplified by PCR using specific primers for the indicated genes. Values represent median ± IQR (a, c) or mean ± SEM (d, e) of three biological replicates. Statistical analyses were performed using a Kruskal-Wallis test (non-parametric, one-way ANOVA with Dunn\\'s post-hoc test) for data presented in (a, c). An ordinary two-way ANOVA (with Tukey\\'s post-hoc multiple comparison test) was used for data presented in (d, e). *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001. MiRNA-200a-3p indirectly regulates IP-10 expression by targeting SOCS6. As shown in Fig. 2a , several JAK-STAT signaling pathway genes were deregulated in mixed IAV-and SP-infected human MDMs; therefore, we hypothesized that miR-200a-3p directly regulates a regulator of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Predictive target analysis indicated that the 3\\' UTR of suppressor of cytokine signaling-6 (SOCS6) may be targeted by miR-200a-3p (Fig. 3b) . SOCS proteins constitute a class of negative regulators of JAK-STAT signaling pathways that are induced by both cytokines and TLR signaling. MiRNA-200a-3p was not predicted to target any of the other six members of the SOCS gene family. Transfection of human MDMs with MIM-200a downregulated SOCS6 (FC = 0.57) while inhibition of miR-200a-3p (INH-200a) upregulated SOCS6 (FC = 1.55), confirming that miR-200a-3p effectively regulates the expression of SOCS6 (Fig. 3e) . Moreover, SOCS6 was synergistically downregulated in IAV-or IAV/SP-infected MDMs overexpressing miRNA-200a (Fig. 3e) , suggesting that both infection and miR-200a-3p negatively regulate the expression of SOCS6. Finally, western blotting confirmed that expression of SOCS-6 sharply reduced following infection, especially after mixed IAV and SP infection (Fig. 3f) .\\n\\nThese results indicate miR-200a-3p is strongly induced in response to mixed viral and bacterial co-infection, which in turn leads to downregulation of the JAK-STAT regulator SOCS-6 at both the mRNA and protein levels and subsequent upregulation of IP-10.\\n\\nanalyses demonstrated mixed IAV and SP infection of human MDMs and HAEC induced significant production of IP-10. As blood leukocytes and respiratory tract epithelial cells actively contribute to inflammation during pneumonia, we hypothesized the level of IP-10 in serum of patient with pneumonia may be both indicative of mixed respiratory infection and disease severity. As part of a prospective, hospital-based, multicenter case-control study on the etiology of pneumonia among children under 5-years-old, a total of 74 patients (44 male, 30 female) were included in this pilot evaluation. According to WHO guidelines, retrospective analysis indicated 44 (59.5%) children had clinical signs of non-severe pneumonia and 30 (40.5%) children had signs of severe pneumonia. The main patient characteristics at inclusion are shown in Table 1 . Patients with severe pneumonia had significant more recorded episodes of dyspnea (P < 0.001), cyanosis (P = 0.03), lower chest indrawing (P < 0.001), dullness to percussion (P < 0.001) and lethargy (P < 0.001) during chest examination than patient with non-severe pneumonia. Moreover, pleural effusions were significantly more observed among critically ill patients and the duration of hospitalization was significantly longer for the children with severe pneumonia than for those with non-severe pneumonia (P = 0.0015). Two deaths occurred within the group of children retrospectively defined with severe pneumonia. Evaluation of the systemic inflammatory response of the 74 cases is shown in Table 2 . Serum level of CRP, IP-10, PCT, G-CSF, IL-6, IL-8 and MIP-1β were significantly more elevated in serum samples from critically ill patients. Patients with severe pneumonia had significantly higher (4.2-fold) serum IP-10 levels than those with a non-severe pneumonia (P < 0.001) suggesting IP-10 as a promising prognostic marker in pneumonia. Diagnostic accuracy measures for predicting pneumonia severity using blood-based biomarkers are summarized in Table S3 . Briefly, in this study, the optimal IP-10 cut-off value for identifying patient with severe pneumonia was 4,240 pg ml −1 , with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.69 (95% CI, 0.57 to 0.82, P < 0.001). Defining as positive a serum IP-10 level above this cut-off resulted in a sensitivity of 63.3%, specificity of 63.6% and a positive likelihood ratio of 1.74. Prognostic values of IP-10 were closed to procalcitonin (PCT; AUC = 0.70; 95% IC, 0.58 to 0.82, P < 0.001) and IL-6 (AUC = 0.70; 95% IC, 0.58-0.83, P < 0.001).\\n\\nMultiplex PCR-based screening of respiratory and blood samples reveal a high variety of pathogen associations (Table 3) . Respiratory viruses were detected in the nasal aspirates (NAs) of 63/74 patients (85.1%). Etiological bacteria of pneumonia (S. pneumoniae, n = 19; S. aureus, n = 1; or H. influenzae type B, n = 7) were identified via real-time PCR in the blood samples of 27/74 (36.5%) of the patients. Multiplex PCR assays allowed the identification of respiratory bacteria in the blood of 19 patients with negative blood culture results. Among the 74 cases PCR-positive for respiratory pathogens, a single virus or bacteria were detected in the NAs of 7 (9.4%) and 3 (4.0%) patients, respectively; these 10/74 (13.5%) cases were defined as the single infection group. The mixed infection group included the 62/74 (83.8%) cases in which (1) multiple viruses and/or bacteria were identified in NAs (38/74; 51.3%) without any bacteria identified in blood samples or (2) one or more viruses and/or bacteria were identified in NAs and associated with a blood bacteremia (24/74; 32.4%). We evaluated whether IP-10 serum level could correlate with the viral and bacterial etiologies of pneumonia. Patients with mixed infection had significant higher (3.6-fold) IP-10 serum level than patient with single detection (P = 0.03; Table 4 ). A stratified analysis reveals that the highest IP-10 serum level was observed among patients with both several respiratory pathogens identified (mixed-detection group) and severe pneumonia (14,427 pg ml −1 , IQR (3,981-82,994). In detail, a remarkable IP-10 serum level (142,531 pg ml −1 ), representing 33-fold higher above cut-off value predicting pneumonia severity was observed in patient with hRV in NA co-detected with S. pneumoniae (serotype 14) in pleural effusion and blood. In concordance with our in-vitro model of co-infection, a significant IP-10 level (90,338 pg ml −1 ) was quantified in blood sample of patient with severe bacteremic pneumococcal (serotype 14) pneumonia with a positive co-detection of Influenza B virus in NA. Taken together, these results suggest that high serum IP-10 levels are significantly associated with mixed viral and bacterial detection and also related to pneumonia pathogenesis.\\n\\nThis study provides additional in vitro and clinical data to improve our understanding of the immunopathology of mixed viral and bacterial pneumonia (Fig. 4) .\\n\\nThe in vitro model of influenza and pneumococcal superinfection of human MDMs demonstrated that mixed infection synergistically induced release of the pro-inflammatory chemokine IP-10, strongly suggesting human Scientific RepoRts | 6:38532 | DOI: 10.1038/srep38532 blood leukocytes contribute to the immunopathology of pneumonia. Additionally, transcriptomics and omics analyses provided new data on the inflammatory pathways that are activated during mixed infection and related to synergistic induction of the pro-inflammatory chemokine IP-10 in mixed infected cells. Our observations are consistent with a recent study describing IP-10 induction as host-proteome signature of both viral and bacterial infections 30 . Of the differentially-expressed genes observed in mixed infected MDMs, the transcription factors STAT-1 and IRF-7 appear to play crucial roles in the regulation of interferon-stimulated genes including CXCL10 (IP-10). By focusing on the intracellular mechanisms that regulate inflammatory pathways, we demonstrated a novel role for miRNA-200a-3p in the regulation of CXCL10 (IP-10). These observations are consistent with previous reports showing that RNA virus infection upregulates miR-155 in macrophages and dendritic cells and also regulates suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1), suggesting the existence of a miRNA/JAK-STAT/SOCS regulatory pathway during viral infection 29 . Our study suggests co-infection leads to overexpression of miR-200a-3p, which in turn targets and downregulates the JAK-STAT regulator SOCS-6 and consequently increases CXCL10 (IP-10) expression. Interestingly, a complementary in-silico approach reveals that several microRNAs that were found dysregulated in our experiments of IAV and SP co-infection of MDMs or HAEC, might target several genes of SOCS family and play similar role than miR-200a-3p. Indeed, miRNA-142-3p might target SOCS4, 5, 6 mRNA while miRNA-194-5p might target SOCS2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 mRNA. These observations underline that intra-cellular regulation of IP-10 is not limited to the contribution of a sole microRNA. A complex inter-relationship between numerous host microRNAs and inhibitors of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway occur to control host innate inflammatory response against viral and/or bacterial infections. Clinically, the majority of pediatric CAP cases in this study were associated with both positive viral and/or bacterial detection. Respiratory microorganisms were detected in 97% of cases; 51.3% of which were viral-viral, viral-bacterial or bacterial-bacterial co-detected only in nasal aspirates, 32.4% of which co-detected in both nasal aspirates and blood samples. These data are consistent with previous etiological studies of pediatric CAP 3,31-33 . S. pneumoniae was the major bacteria identified in blood (19/74; 25.7%) and mainly co-detected with respiratory viruses in NAs (16/19; 84.2%). We observed a very high diversity of viral and bacterial associations in biological samples from children with pneumonia. In comparison with IAV and SP14 combination evaluated in-vitro, no pneumonia cases were singly influenza and pneumococcus infected, and no similar co-detection with those two pathogens has been clinically observed. Nevertheless, Influenza B (IVB) virus was identified in 5 patients and two of them had a positive SP co-detection in blood (one non-typable strain and one serotype 14 using our molecular typing test). IVB and SP14 combination seems to be the nearest pathogen co-detection to that in-vitro investigated. Clinically, this co-detection was associated with both a very high IP-10 expression and a very severe pneumonia case definition. Interestingly, our translational pilot evaluation reveals IP-10 expression can be induced by several different viral and/or bacterial combinations. As immune response to each pathogen is different, further in-vitro investigations using different pathogens associations are needed to better characterize the mechanisms involved in the immunopathology of pneumonia.\\n\\nIn this cohort, highest serum IP-10 levels were identified among patients with both several pathogen detected and severe pneumonia, suggesting a significant role of IP-10 on pneumonia pathogenesis. Indeed, high plasma levels of IP-10 have previously been reported in patients with sepsis 12 , and were associated with high mortality rate, especially among patients with CAP 34 . Additionally, the IP-10-CXCR3 axis has been related to acute immune lung injury and lymphocyte apoptosis during the development of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 35, 36 . Moreover, an in vivo study that modeled influenza and pneumococcal superinfection in mice indicated that pro-inflammatory chemokines, including IP-10, play a crucial role in influenza-induced susceptibility to lung neutrophilia, severe immunopathology and mortality 37 . In this study, markedly elevated IP-10 (92,809 pg ml −1 ) combined with the highest PCT level (74.4 pg ml −1 ) were quantified in the serum sample of a child who died, in whom S. pneumoniae (serotype 9 V) was identified in the blood (PCR and blood culture) and co-detected with Haemophilus influenzae type B in nasal aspirate. These observations suggest an interrelationship between co-detection, elevated serum IP-10 and the pathogenesis of pneumonia.\\n\\nSeveral limitations of this pilot translational study need to be acknowledged before concluding mixed infection is related to elevated IP-10 and disease severity. Indeed, although viral shedding (e.g., of HRV and HBoV) is common in asymptomatic children, we were unable to evaluate the levels of immunomodulators in the serum samples of a control group. Moreover, although the samples were collected within the first 24 hours after admission, only a single blood sample was processed for each patient. Therefore, a larger, longitudinal study on the etiology and severity of pneumonia will be necessary to confirm these results. In conclusion, the present findings suggest that mixed respiratory infections and IP-10 may play major, interconnected roles in the pathogenesis of pneumonia. Clinically, assessment and monitoring of induced IP-10 serum level may assist clinicians to improve diagnosis and patient management of severe community-acquired pneumonia.\\n\\nViral and bacterial strains.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the magnitude of mental health outcomes and associated factors among health care workers treating patients exposed to COVID-19 in China. DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional, survey-based, region-stratified study collected demographic data and mental health measurements from 1257 health care workers in 34 hospitals from January 29, 2020, to February 3, 2020, in China. Health care workers in hospitals equipped with fever clinics or wards for patients with COVID-19 were eligible. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The degree of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress was assessed by the Chinese versions of the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, the 7-item Insomnia Severity Index, and the 22-item Impact of Event Scale–Revised, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with mental health outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 1257 of 1830 contacted individuals completed the survey, with a participation rate of 68.7%. A total of 813 (64.7%) were aged 26 to 40 years, and 964 (76.7%) were women. Of all participants, 764 (60.8%) were nurses, and 493 (39.2%) were physicians; 760 (60.5%) worked in hospitals in Wuhan, and 522 (41.5%) were frontline health care workers. A considerable proportion of participants reported symptoms of depression (634 [50.4%]), anxiety (560 [44.6%]), insomnia (427 [34.0%]), and distress (899 [71.5%]). Nurses, women, frontline health care workers, and those working in Wuhan, China, reported more severe degrees of all measurements of mental health symptoms than other health care workers (eg, median [IQR] Patient Health Questionnaire scores among physicians vs nurses: 4.0 [1.0-7.0] vs 5.0 [2.0-8.0]; P = .007; median [interquartile range {IQR}] Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale scores among men vs women: 2.0 [0-6.0] vs 4.0 [1.0-7.0]; P < .001; median [IQR] Insomnia Severity Index scores among frontline vs second-line workers: 6.0 [2.0-11.0] vs 4.0 [1.0-8.0]; P < .001; median [IQR] Impact of Event Scale–Revised scores among those in Wuhan vs those in Hubei outside Wuhan and those outside Hubei: 21.0 [8.5-34.5] vs 18.0 [6.0-28.0] in Hubei outside Wuhan and 15.0 [4.0-26.0] outside Hubei; P < .001). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed participants from outside Hubei province were associated with lower risk of experiencing symptoms of distress compared with those in Wuhan (odds ratio [OR], 0.62; 95% CI, 0.43-0.88; P = .008). Frontline health care workers engaged in direct diagnosis, treatment, and care of patients with COVID-19 were associated with a higher risk of symptoms of depression (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.11-2.09; P = .01), anxiety (OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.22-2.02; P < .001), insomnia (OR, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.92-4.60; P < .001), and distress (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.25-2.04; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this survey of heath care workers in hospitals equipped with fever clinics or wards for patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan and other regions in China, participants reported experiencing psychological burden, especially nurses, women, those in Wuhan, and frontline health care workers directly engaged in the diagnosis, treatment, and care for patients with COVID-19.\\n\\nText: Abbreviation: PHQ-9, 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire; GAD-7, 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder; ISI, 7-item Insomnia Severity Index; IES-R, 22-item Impact of Event Abbreviation: IES-R, 22-item Impact of Event Scale-Revised; IQR, interquartile range.

No approved drug is available for the specific treatment of JEV infections, and the available vaccines are not effective against all clinical JEV isolates. In the study described here, a high-throughput screening of an FDA-approved drug library for inhibitors of JEV was performed. Five hit drugs that inhibited JEV infection with a selective index of >10 were identified. The antiviral activities of these five hit drugs against other flavivirus, including Zika virus, were also validated. As three of the five hit drugs were calcium inhibitors, additional types of calcium inhibitors that confirmed that calcium is essential for JEV infection, most likely during viral replication, were utilized. Adaptive mutant analysis uncovered that replacement of Q130, located in transmembrane domain 3 of the nonstructural NS4B protein, which is relatively conserved in flaviviruses, with R or K conferred JEV resistance to manidipine, a voltage-gated Ca(2+) channel (VGCC) inhibitor, without an apparent loss of the viral growth profile. Furthermore, manidipine was indicated to protect mice against JEV-induced lethality by decreasing the viral load in the brain, while it abrogated the histopathological changes associated with JEV infection. This study provides five antiflavivirus candidates and identifies cytoplasmic calcium to be a novel antiviral target for the treatment of JEV infection. The findings reported here provide therapeutic possibilities for combating infections caused by flaviviruses. IMPORTANCE No approved therapy for the treatment of Japanese encephalitis virus infection is currently available. Repurposing of approved drugs would accelerate the development of a therapeutic stratagem. In this study, we screened a library of FDA-approved drugs and identified five hit drugs, especially calcium inhibitors, exerting antiflavivirus activity that blocked viral replication. The in vivo efficacy and toxicity of manidipine were investigated with a mouse model of JEV infection, and the viral target was identified by generating an adaptive mutant.\\n\\nText: F laviviruses are taxonomically classified in the genus Flavivirus and family Flaviviridae.\\n\\nThese viruses comprise over 70 different pathogens, such as Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), Zika virus (ZIKV), dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), and yellow fever virus (YFV). Most flaviviruses are arthropod borne and cause public health problems worldwide (1) . The development and usage of vaccines against some flaviviruses, such as JEV, YFV, and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), have decreased the rates of morbidity and mortality from infections caused by these viruses (2) ; however, flavivirus-induced diseases are still pandemic, and few therapies beyond intensive supportive care are currently available.\\n\\nFlaviviruses have an approximately 11-kb positive-stranded RNA genome containing a single open reading frame (ORF) flanked by untranslated regions (UTRs) at both termini. The ORF encodes three structural proteins, including the capsid (C), membrane (premembrane [prM] and membrane [M] ), and envelope (E), and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) (3) . These seven nonstructural proteins participate in viral replication, virion assembly, and virus escape from immune surveillance.\\n\\nTo date, no specific antivirals with activity against flaviviruses are available. To address this, we conducted a screen of a library of 1,018 FDA-approved drugs. Since flaviviruses are similar in structure and pathogenesis, we first utilized JEV as the prototype to screen the drug library and subsequently validated the antiviral activities with ZIKV, WNV, and DENV type 2 (DENV-2). The hit drugs identified in this study offer potential new therapies for the treatment of flavivirus infection and disease.\\n\\nScreening of an FDA-approved drug library for inhibitors of JEV infection. Recombinant viral particles (RVPs) with the luciferase-reporting replicon enveloped by the JEV structural proteins were used to select inhibitors, with a focus on those that inhibit virus entry and replication, by a high-throughput screening (HTS) assay (4, 5) . The number of genomic RNA copies of RVP was determined to be 8.4 ϫ 10 6 copies/ml by using a standard curve generated with plasmids carrying the infectious clone. The HTS assay conditions, including the seeding cell density and RVP dose, were optimized to be 10,000 cells per 96-well plate and 20 l (16 copies/cell) RVP for the infective dose, respectively. Under the optimized conditions, the signal-to-basal (S/B) ratio, coefficient of variation (CV), and Z= factor were 38,374, 2.8%, and 0.89, respectively, which demonstrated that the assay was robust and suitable for the large-scale screening of compounds.\\n\\nA schematic of the HTS assay is depicted in Fig. 1B . After three rounds of screening, five hits with a selective index (SI; which is equal to the 50% cytotoxic concentration [CC 50 [/50% inhibitory concentration [IC 50 ]) of Ͼ10 were selected. The CC 50 values of the hit drugs exhibited in Fig. 1B were similar to those previously published for diverse cell systems but determined using different toxicity assays (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) . Three of the hit drugs, manidipine, cilnidipine, and benidipine hydrochloride, were dihydropyridine (DHP) voltage-gated Ca 2ϩ channel (VGCC) antagonists, while pimecrolimus is an inhibitor of inflammatory cytokine secretion and nelfinavir mesylate is an HIV-1 protease blocker. All five drugs exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of JEV RVP infection (Fig. 1C) . To validate the antiviral effect, hit drugs were purchased from other commercial sources and tested. In the reconfirmation screen, all hit drugs showed antiviral and cytotoxic effects similar to those found in the primary screen.\\n\\nValidation of hit drugs. To verify the results obtained by the luciferase reporter assays, we also investigated the antiviral effect of the five hit drugs on wild-type JEV strain AT31. As expected from the HTS assay, all five drugs robustly inhibited virus production, with a reduction of approximately 4 to 5 log units at the highest concentration and an approximately 1-log-unit decrease with 2.5 M the drugs (Fig. 2B) . A sharp decrease in JEV RNA levels was also detected (Fig. 2C) . The attenuated RNA levels in the high-dose, middle-dose, and low-dose groups were all above 40%. In particular, in the manidipine-treated group, the inhibitory effect was at least 80% compared to that for the control, which showed a strong inhibition of viral replication. Consistent with the inhibition of virus replication and production, expression of the viral structural protein prM was hardly detectable following treatment with the drugs at the high concentration (Fig. 2D) . Overall, the results in Fig. 2 confirmed that the five hit drugs inhibited JEV infection in a dose-dependent manner in vitro.\\n\\nDrugs inhibit JEV infection during viral RNA synthesis. Because RVPs, which have a natural virus-like envelope on the outside and a replicon on the inside, permitted the quantification of JEV productive entry and replication, a time-of-addition experiment was performed to investigate whether the hit drugs blocked the entry step or the replication step. As shown in Fig. 3B , no suppression of luciferase activity by any of the hit drugs was observed when they were used as treatments before infection or during infection or as a virucide, suggesting that these drugs do not inhibit JEV infection either by inactivating the virus directly or by blocking JEV entry. However, these drugs exerted fully inhibitory effects when they were added at 1 h postinfection, suggesting that viral replication was the stage at which these drugs showed inhibitory activity.\\n\\nTo confirm this suggestion, we investigated the inhibitory effects of these drugs on the JEV replicon. The highest concentration of manidipine and nelfinavir mesylate tested in baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells was adjusted to 5 M and 10 M, respectively. It was shown that all five drugs inhibited JEV RNA synthesis in a dosedependent manner, while neither drug inhibited the initial translation of replicon RNA (5, 14) (Fig. 3C) , confirming that these drugs inhibited JEV infection at the stage of replication.\\n\\nHit drugs exhibit broad-spectrum antiflavivirus activity. In order to determine whether the antiviral activity of the five hit drugs extended to other flaviviruses, we explored their antiviral effect against ZIKV. Similar to the findings for JEV, the ZIKV titer was decreased by multiple log units when ZIKV was treated with a high concentration of each of the drugs (Fig. 4A) . Moreover, ZIKV exhibited a higher sensitivity to the two calcium channels inhibitors manidipine and cilnidipine than JEV, with no plaque formation being observed at 10 M. Consistent with this result, sharp decreases in the level of replication of ZIKV RNA and the level of expression of viral protein were also detected (Fig. 4A) . Notably, treatment with 5 M manidipine produced a 95% inhibition of viral replication, translation, and viral yields. Taken together, these results indicate that the hit drugs could effectively inhibit ZIKV infection.\\n\\nSince these drugs exhibited their anti-JEV effects at the stage of viral replication, we further tested the effects against WNV and DENV-2 by using WNV and DENV-2 replicons. Similar to the results for JEV, a dose-dependent reduction in the level of WNV replication was observed with the drug treatments. The same phenotype was observed for DENV-2 for all drugs except nelfinavir mesylate, which showed no effect at the concentrations tested ( Fig. 4B and C). Together, these results indicate that the five hit drugs are excellent candidates for broad-spectrum antiflavivirus treatment. Antiviral effect of calcium inhibitors. Since three hit drugs, manidipine, cilnidipine, and benidipine hydrochloride, were DHP VGCC inhibitors, we asked whether other calcium antagonists could block JEV infection. To address this question, we employed four different classes of inhibitors. Verapamil, a prototype phenylalkylamine (PAA) VGCC inhibitor (15) , exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of JEV on both African Green monkey kidney (Vero) and human hepatocellular carcinoma (Huh-7) cells (Fig. 5) , which was consistent with the inhibitory effects of the DHP inhibitors, suggesting that calcium channels play an important role in JEV infection. Cyclosporine and 2-aminobiphenyl borate (2-APB), which inhibit the efflux of Ca 2ϩ from the mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) pool, respectively (16) (17) (18) (19) , were also found to block JEV infection effectively. Similarly, treatment with the cell-permeant Ca 2ϩ chelator 1,2-bis-(o-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N=,N=-tetraacetic acid, tetraacetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA-AM), could also suppress JEV infection. Taken together, we concluded that intracellular Ca 2ϩ is essential for JEV infection and cytoplasmic calcium is a potent target for antiflavivirus treatment.\\n\\nSelection and characterization of manidipine-resistant JEV. To identify the viral target of the calcium channel inhibitor, we selected a manidipine-resistant virus by serially passaging JEV in the presence of manidipine. Viruses from passage 20 (P20) showed robust resistance compared with the wild type (WT) (Fig. 6A ). When JEV from P20 was treated with 5 M or 10 M manidipine, the viral titer was about 10-and 100-fold higher than that of the WT, respectively. Individual virus clones were isolated, and two isolates were randomly selected and amplified. An amino acid substitution was observed in two isolated clones, resulting in a glutamine (Q)-to-arginine (R) switch at amino acid position 130 in transmembrane domain 3 (TMD3) of NS4B, i.e., position 2401 of the translated polyprotein in the JEV infectious cDNA clone (Fig. 6B ). Sequence alignment of NS4B indicated that Q130 was conserved in all flaviviruses except YFV, which possessed a lysine at that position (Fig.  6B) . The conserved Q130 of NS4B may account for the sensitivity of JEV, ZIKV, WNV, and DENV-2 to manidipine, as described above (Fig. 4) , while YFV showed resistance to the drug (data not shown).\\n\\nTo confirm that the Q130R mutation did confer manidipine resistance and to investigate the role of Q130 in NS4B function, we produced JEV clones with the Q130R, Q130K, Q130E, or Q130A mutation by introducing the desired mutations into the infectious cDNA clone and rescuing the mutant viruses. To investigate the biological properties of the mutant viruses, we first examined the growth kinetics of the rescued viruses. As shown in Fig. 6C , all mutant viruses had an accumulation of infectious virions and reached the highest titer at 60 h postinfection. Infection of the Q130R and Q130K mutant viruses resulted in growth curves similar to the growth curve for the WT (Fig.  6C) , while the Q130E and Q130A mutants produced smaller amounts of viruses between 24 and 60 h. Analysis of the plaque morphology revealed that the plaques of the Q130R, Q130K, and Q130E mutants were similar to the plaques of the WT, whereas the plaques of the Q130A mutant were smaller than those of the WT.\\n\\nWe next investigated the sensitivity of the four mutant viruses to manidipine. As shown in Fig. 6D , the Q130R and Q130K mutant viruses were resistant to manidipine. At a 10 M concentration, manidipine efficiently inhibited WT JEV infection and reduced the viral yields by approximately 4 log units, while the Q130R and Q130K mutant viruses were resistant to manidipine and the viral titer decreased less than 2 log units. The Q130A mutant virus demonstrated moderate resistance and a slightly higher Taken together, it could be concluded that Q130 not only is critical for conferring manidipine sensitivity but also is important for JEV replication. The replacement of glutamine with basic amino acids conferred resistance to manidipine without an apparent loss of growth.\\n\\nIn vivo efficacy of manidipine. As manidipine exhibited the strongest inhibitory activities on JEV replication as well as ZIKV infection when its activities were compared with those of the five hit drugs (Fig. 2 and 4A) , we further examined the protective effect of manidipine against JEV-induced lethality in a mouse model. As anticipated, mice in the JEV-infected vehicle-treated group started to show symptoms, including limb paralysis, restriction of movement, piloerection, body stiffening, and whole-body tremor, from day 5 postinfection. Within 21 days postinfection, most mice in the JEV-infected group succumbed to the infection, with the mortality rate being 73% (4 out of 15 animals survived). Manidipine treatment following JEV infection reduced the mortality rate to 20% (12 out of 15 animals survived) (Fig. 7A ). Mice treated with manidipine alone or treated with manidipine and infected with JEV showed little abnormal behavior, similar to the findings for the mice in the vehicle-treated group. These results suggest that manidipine provided effective protection against JEVinduced mortality.\\n\\nTo further relate these protective effects to the viral load and histopathological changes in the mouse brains, the viral titer was determined and mouse brain sections were collected and assayed at day 5 and day 21 postinfection, since mice started to show symptoms of JEV infection from day 5 postinfection and most of the surviving mice had recovered at day 21. The results indicated that, during the progression of the disease, manidipine treatment significantly reduced the viral load in infected mice compared to that in infected mice not receiving treatment, while no plaques formed in either the manidipine-or vehicle-treated group, and viral loads were undetectable in each group on day 21 postinfection (Fig. 7B) . As JEV was rapidly cleared from the blood after inoculation and was present in the lymphatic system during the preclinical phase, the effects of manidipine on infection of serum and the spleen were evaluated at earlier time points to detect whether the drug reduced the peripheral viral loads (20, 21) . As shown in Fig. 7C , manidipine had little effect on peripheral JEV infection, which indicated that manidipine protected the mice against JEV-induced lethality by decreasing the viral load in the brain. Similarly, apparent damage in the brain, including meningitis, perivascular cuffing, vacuolar degeneration, and glial nodules, was observed in the JEV-infected and vehicle-treated group on day 5 postinfection, while manidipine treatment remarkably alleviated these phenomena (Fig. 7D) . These results indicate that the alleviation of histopathological changes was accompanied by a reduction in the viral load as well as a reduction in the rate of mortality, further confirming the curative effects of manidipine on viral encephalitis.\\n\\nAmong the five hit drugs, manidipine, cilnidipine, and benidipine hydrochloride were VGCC inhibitors. It has been well documented in the literature that Ca 2ϩ inhibitors serve to inhibit virus infection at the stage of either entry (15, 22) or replication (18) and even at the stage of budding (23) . To this end, we first reviewed all 21 calcium inhibitors included in the current library of FDA-approved drugs and found that, in addition to the four DHP VGCC inhibitors listed in Fig. 1B , two other calcium inhibitors, i.e., flunarizine dihydrochloride and lomerizine hydrochloride, were also identified to be primary candidates with levels of inhibition of Ͼ90%. Similarly, three calcium channel antagonists, nisoldipine, felodipine, and nicardipine hydrochloride, showed levels of inhibition of 75%, 72%, and 66%, respectively, in the primary screen. Together, 9 of the 21 calcium inhibitors in the library, accounting for nearly half of the calcium inhibitors, exhibited levels of flavivirus inhibition of greater than 50%, suggesting that calcium, especially the calcium channel, is a potential antiviral target. To address this, another type of VGCC inhibitor, verapamil, an FDA-approved drug not yet included in the drug library used in this study, was investigated. Likewise, a Ca 2ϩ chelator, BAPTA-AM, as well as the Ca 2ϩ inhibitors 2-APB and cyclosporine, targeting ER and the mitochondrial Ca 2ϩ channel, respectively, were employed to investigate the response of JEV infection to the decrease in intracellular Ca 2ϩ levels. In line with the activities of the three hit DHP VGCC inhibitor drugs, the additional Ca 2ϩ inhibitors exerted anti-JEV activity, which indicated that Ca 2ϩ is indispensable for JEV infection. Thus, Ca 2ϩ inhibitors might be utilized as effective treatments for flavivirus infection.\\n\\nAs the hit drugs exerted full inhibitory activity when they were added posttreatment, we believe that Ca 2ϩ is important for flavivirus genome replication. Furthermore, selection and genetic analysis of drug-resistant viruses revealed that NS4B is the viral target of manidipine. NS4B is part of the viral replication complex and is supposed to anchor the viral replicase to the ER membrane (24) . Meanwhile, the N-terminal 125amino-acid domain of DENV NS4B was indicated to be responsible for inhibition of the immune response (25) . Notably, several structurally distinct compounds have been identified to inhibit flavivirus replication by intensively targeting the TMD of NS4B (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) . It is thus conceivable that inhibitors targeting TMD of NS4B would perturb its function, leading to the suppression of viral RNA replication. In this study, the replacement of Q130 of NS4B with a basic amino acid conferred the resistance effect without suppressing JEV replication, suggesting that position 130 could tolerate a basic amino acid and that the basic amino acid might be involved in the interplay of NS4B with host proteins rather than viral proteins.\\n\\nMoreover, the efficacy and toxicity of manidipine were monitored in vivo, with manidipine demonstrating effective antiviral activity with favorable biocompatibility. However, the dose used in this study was higher than the dose typically used clinically, representing one of the scenarios most commonly encountered in drug repurposing (33, 34) . As manidipine was approved for use for the long-term treatment of hypertension (35, 36) , pulse-dose treatment with manidipine over the shorter period of time required for the treatment of virus infection might be relatively safe. Moreover, use of a combination of manidipine with other Ca 2ϩ inhibitors might improve its therapeutic efficacy, reduce its toxicity, and reduce the risk of resistance development (37) (38) (39) .\\n\\nBesides the three VGCC inhibitors, two hit drugs, pimecrolimus and nelfinavir mesylate, showed equivalent inhibitory activities on the replication of JEV, ZIKV, WNV, and DENV-2. Although there has been no report on the use of pimecrolimus for the treatment of infectious diseases, we showed that it had a robust effect against JEV with an SI of Ͼ32. The maximum plasma concentration (C max ) of nelfinavir mesylate achieved with an adult dose was 3 to 4 g/ml (40) , which was comparable to the IC 50 reported here. Notably, nelfinavir mesylate was confirmed to inhibit herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and the replication of several other herpesviruses by interfering directly or indirectly with the later steps of virus formation, such as glycoprotein maturation or virion release, other than functioning in herpesviruses protease (41, 42) . Whether nelfinavir mesylate inhibits flavivirus by interference with the virus protease or by other off-target effects is unknown. Understanding of the mechanism of the antiflavivirus effects of these drugs might uncover novel targets of the drugs, providing further insight into the pathogenesis of flaviviruses.\\n\\nAbove all, the findings reported here provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying flavivirus infection and offer new and promising therapeutic possibilities for combating infections caused by flaviviruses.\\n\\nCells and viruses. BHK-21, SH-SY5Y (human neuroblastoma), Vero, and Huh-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (HyClone, Logan, UT, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA). JEV strain AT31, the WNV replicon, and the DENV-2 replicon expressing Renilla luciferase (Rluc) were kindly provided by Bo Zhang, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), China. JEV replicon recombinant viral particles (RVPs) were generated as previously described (4, 5) . ZIKV strain H/PF/2013, kindly provided by the European Virus Archive Goes Global, was propagated and titrated in Vero cells.\\n\\nOptimization of HTS assay conditions. The cell density and RVP dose were optimized for the HTS assay. Vero cells at different densities (2,500 to 12,500 cells per well) were infected with from 1.25 to 20 l RVPs (1 to 16 copies per well). The appropriate cell density as well as the RVP dose was selected by comparing the S/B ratio, CV, and Z= values under different conditions as previously described (43) . Methyl-␤-cyclodextrin and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were used as positive and negative controls, respectively.\\n\\nHTS assay of an FDA-approved compound library. A library of 1,018 FDA-approved drugs was purchased from Selleck Chemicals (Houston, TX, USA). The compounds were stored as 10 mM stock solutions in DMSO at 4°C until use. The first round of the HTS assay was carried out as shown in Fig. 1A . The criteria used to identify the primary candidates were no apparent cytotoxicity and an average level of inhibition of Ͼ90% in duplicate wells. The criteria of dose-dependent inhibition and cell viability of Ͼ80% were applied for the reconfirmation screen. Furthermore, the CC 50 of each compound was calculated, and those compounds displaying SIs over 10 were considered hits in this study.\\n\\nIdentification of antiviral effects of five hit drugs. The antiviral effects of the drugs were evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR), immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and plaque assay as previously reported (44) (45) (46) (47) . The experimental timeline is depicted in Fig. 2A .\\n\\nTo ensure the effectiveness of the hit drugs in flavivirus replication, BHK-21 cells transfected with the JEV, WNV, or DENV-2 replicon were incubated with each drug at the concentrations indicated above, and the luciferase activities were determined 24 h, 48 h, or 72 h later, respectively.\\n\\nTime-of-addition experiment. To evaluate which stage of the JEV life cycle was inhibited by each hit, a time-of-addition experiment was performed as previously described (43) . Vero cells were infected with 20 l RVPs for 1 h (0 to 1 h). The test compounds were incubated with the cells for 1 h before infection (Ϫ1 to 0 h), during infection (0 to 1 h), and for 23 h postinfection (1 to 24 h) (Fig. 3A) . To exclude a possible direct inactivating effect of the drugs, RVPs were incubated with each drug at 37°C for 1 h, and the mixtures were diluted 25-fold to infect Vero cells. Twenty-four hours later, the luciferase activities were determined as described above (Fig. 3A) .\\n\\nManidipine-resistant virus. Manidipine-resistant virus was generated by passaging of JEV on Vero cells in the presence of manidipine. Passages 1 to 10 used 5 M manidipine, and passages 11 to 20 used 10 M manidipine. As a control, WT virus was passaged in the presence of 2% DMSO in parallel. Passaging was terminated at passage 20, when no further improvement in resistance was detected. Two manidipine-resistant virus isolates were plaque purified and amplified in the presence of manidipine. Viral RNA was extracted, amplified, and purified for sequencing. An infectious cDNA clone of JEV, strain AT31 (pMWJEAT), kindly provided by T. Wakita, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute for Neuroscience, was used to recover WT and mutant viruses as described previously (4) . Virus titers and manidipine sensitivities were determined by plaque assay in Vero cells.\\n\\nManidipine administration to JEV-infected mice. Adult female BALB/c mice (age, 4 weeks) were kept in the Laboratory Animal Center of Wuhan Institute of Virology, CAS (Wuhan, China). The mice were randomly divided into four groups (30 mice per group): a JEV-infected and vehicle (2% Tween 80 plus 5% DMSO in phosphate-buffered saline [PBS])-treated group, a manidipine-treated group, a JEV-infected and manidipine-treated group, and a vehicle-treated group. For infection, mice were infected intraperitoneally with 5 ϫ 10 6 PFU of JEV strain AT31. For the manidipine and vehicle treatments, mice were injected intraperitoneally with 25 mg/kg of body weight manidipine or PBS with 2% Tween 80 and 5% DMSO, respectively. Treatments were administered twice a day for the first 2 days and then consecutively administered once a day for up to 21 days. Five mice from each group were sacrificed on days 1, 3, and 5 postinfection. Serum, spleen tissue, and brain tissue samples were collected for viral titer determination and histopathology investigation. Fifteen mice were monitored daily for morbidity and mortality. The mice that showed neurological signs of disease were euthanized according to the Regulations for the Administration of Affairs Concerning Experimental Animals in China. The protocols were reviewed and approved by the Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, CAS (Wuhan, China).'}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '1faa93d0f6accf5d88e763ca008c91b7'}>,\n",

Although apparently disadvantaged by their dependence on the host biosynthetic processes, an immensely faster rate of evolution provides viruses with an edge in this conflict. In this review, I have discussed the potential anti-virus activity of inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), a well characterized effector of the cellular homeostatic response to an overloading of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein-folding capacity. IRE1, an ER-membrane-resident ribonuclease (RNase), upon activation catalyses regulated cleavage of select protein-coding and non-coding host RNAs, using an RNase domain which is homologous to that of the known anti-viral effector RNaseL. The latter operates as part of the Oligoadenylate synthetase OAS/RNaseL system of anti-viral defense mechanism. Protein-coding RNA substrates are differentially treated by the IRE1 RNase to either augment, through cytoplasmic splicing of an intron in the Xbp1 transcript, or suppress gene expression. This referred suppression of gene expression is mediated through degradative cleavage of a select cohort of cellular RNA transcripts, initiating the regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD) pathway. The review first discusses the anti-viral mechanism of the OAS/RNaseL system and evasion tactics employed by different viruses. This is followed by a review of the RIDD pathway and its potential effect on the stability of viral RNAs. I conclude with a comparison of the enzymatic activity of the two RNases followed by deliberations on the physiological consequences of their activation.\\n\\nText: Establishment of infection by a virus, even in permissive host cells, is beset with a plethora of challenges from innate-antiviral and cell-death pathways. Therefore, the host response to a virus infection might prove to be inhibitory for the viral life cycle in a direct or an indirect manner. The direct mechanism involves expression of multiple anti-viral genes that have evolved to recognize, react, and thereby rid the infected host of the viral nucleic acid (Zhou et al., 1997; Thompson et al., 2011) . On the other hand the pathways, e.g., those that culminate in initiating an apoptotic death for the host cell, indirectly serve to limit the spread of virus (Roulston et al., 1999) . A major difference between these two mechanisms is that while the former response is transmissible to neighboring uninfected cells through interferon (IFN) signaling, the latter is observed mostly in cis. Recent reports, however, have demonstrated transmission of an apoptotic signal between cells that are in contact through gap junctions, although such a signaling from an virus infected host cell to an uninfected one is not known yet (Cusato et al., 2003; Udawatte and Ripps, 2005; Kameritsch et al., 2013) . Successful viral pathogens, through a process of active selection, have evolved to replicate and simultaneously evade or block either of these host responses. The viral nucleic acids which could be the genome (positive-sense singlestranded RNA virus) or RNA derived from transcription of the genome [negative-stranded single-sense RNA or double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) or DNA virus], offer critical targets for both detection and eradication. The viral nucleic acid targeting armaments in the host arsenal include those that recognize the associated molecular patterns like toll-like receptors (TLRs), DDX58 (or RIG-1), IFIH1 (or MDA5), IFIT proteins [IFN-stimulated genes (ISG)56 and ISF54], etc. (Aoshi et al., 2011; Bowzard et al., 2011; Jensen and Thomsen, 2012) . This is followed by IFN signaling and expression or activation of factors that target the inducer for degradation or modification like OAS/ribonuclease L (RNaseL) system, APOBEC3, MCPIP1, the ZC3HAV1/exosome system and RNAi pathways (Gao et al., 2002; Sheehy et al., 2002; Guo et al., 2007; Daffis et al., 2010; Sidahmed and Wilkie, 2010; Schmidt et al., 2012; Cho et al., 2013a; Lin et al., 2013) . In this review we focus on two proteins containing homologous RNase domains, RNaseL with a known direct antiviral function and Inositolrequiring enzyme 1 (IRE1 or ERN1) which has an RNaseL-like RNase domain with a known role in homeostatic response to unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and a potential to function as an antiviral (Figure 1 ; Tirasophon et al., 2000) .\\n\\nIn mammalian cells the tell-tale signs of RNA virus infection, like the presence of cytosolic RNA having 5 -ppp or extensive (>30 bp) dsRNA segments are detected by dedicated pathogen associated molecular pattern receptors (PAMPs) or pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in the host cell, like RIG-1, MDA5, and the IFIT family of proteins (Aoshi et al., 2011; Bowzard et al., 2011; Vabret and Blander, 2013) . The transduction of a signal of this recognition results in the expression of IFN genes the products www.frontiersin.org FIGURE 1 | Schematic representation of the ribonuclease activity of IRE1 and RNaseL showing cross-talk between the paths catalysed by the enzymes. The figure shows activation of RNase activity following dimerization triggered by either accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER-lumen or synthesis of 2-5A by the enzyme OAS, respectively, for IRE1 and RNaseL. The cleavage of Xbp1u by IRE1 releases an intron thus generating Xbp1s. The IRE1 targets in RIDD pathway or all RNaseL substrates are shown to undergo degradative cleavage. The cleavage products generated through degradation of the respective substrate is shown to potentially interact with RIG-I thereby leading to Interferon secretion and trans-activation of Oas genes through Interferon signaling. Abbreviations: RIG-I = retinoic acid inducible gene-I, Ifnb = interferon beta gene loci, IFN = interferons, ISG = interferon-sensitive genes, 2-5A = 2 -5 oligoadenylates.\\n\\nof which upon secretion outside the cell bind to cognate receptors, initiating further downstream signaling (Figure 1 ; Randall and Goodbourn, 2008) . The genes that are regulated as a result of IFN signaling are termed as IFN-stimulated or IFN-regulated genes (ISGs or IRGs; Sen and Sarkar, 2007; Schoggins and Rice, 2011) . Oligoadenylate synthetase or OAS genes are canonical ISGs that convert ATP into 2 -5 linked oligoadenylates (2-5A) by an unique enzymatic mechanism (Figure 1 ; Hartmann et al., 2003) . Further, they are RNA-binding proteins that function like PRRs, in a way that the 2-5A synthesizing activity needs to be induced through an interaction with dsRNA (Minks et al., 1979; Hartmann et al., 2003) . In a host cell infected by an RNA virus, such dsRNA is present in the form of replication-intermediates (RI), which are synthesized by the virus-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) and subsequently used by the same enzyme to synthesize more genomic RNA, through asymmetric transcription (Weber et al., 2006) . However, the replications complexes (RCs) harboring these RI molecules are found secluded inside host-membrane derived vesicles, at least in positive-strand RNA viruses, a group which contains many human pathogens (Uchil and Satchidanandam, 2003; Denison, 2008) . Reports from different groups suggest OAS proteins to be distributed both in the cytoplasm as well as in membrane-associated fractions, perhaps indicating an evolution of the host anti-viral methodologies towards detection of the membrane-associated viral dsRNAs (Marie et al., 1990; Lin et al., 2009) . DNA viruses on the other hand, produce dsRNA by annealing of RNA derived from transcription of both strands in the same viral genomic loci, which are probably detected by the cytoplasmic pool of OAS proteins (Jacobs and Langland, 1996; Weber et al., 2006) . Post-activation the OAS enzymes synthesize 2-5A molecules in a non-processive reaction producing oligomers which, although potentially ranging in size from dimeric to multimeric, are functionally active only in a trimeric or tetrameric form (Dong et al., 1994; Sarkar et al., 1999; Silverman, 2007) . These small ligands, which bear phosphate groups (1-3) at the 5 end and hydroxyl groups at the 2 and 3 positions, serve as co-factor which can specifically interact with and thereby allosterically activate, existing RNaseL molecules (Knight et al., 1980; Zhou et al., 1997 Zhou et al., , 2005 Sarkar et al., 1999) . As part of a physiological control system these 2-5A oligomers are quite unstable in that they are highly susceptible to degradation by cellular 5 -phosphatases and PDE12 (2 -phosphodiesterase; Silverman et al., 1981; Johnston and Hearl, 1987; Kubota et al., 2004; Schmidt et al., 2012) . Viral strategies to evade or overcome this host defense mechanism ranges from preventing IFN signaling which would hinder the induction of OAS expression or thwarting activation of expressed OAS proteins by either shielding the viral dsRNA from interacting with it or modulating the host pathway to synthesize inactive 2-5A derivatives (Cayley et al., 1984; Hersh et al., 1984; Rice et al., 1985; Maitra et al., 1994; Beattie et al., 1995; Rivas et al., 1998; Child et al., 2004; Min and Krug, 2006; Sanchez and Mohr, 2007; Sorgeloos et al., 2013) . Shielding of viral RNA from interacting with OAS is possible through enclosure of dsRNA replication intermediates in membrane enclosed compartments as observed in many flaviviruses (Ahlquist, 2006; Miller and Krijnse-Locker, 2008; Miorin et al., 2013) .\\n\\nRNaseL is a 741 amino acid protein containing three predominantly structured region, an N-terminal ankyrin repeat domain (ARD), a middle catalytically inactive pseudo-kinase (PK) and a C-terminal RNase domain (Figure 2A ; Hassel et al., 1993; Zhou et al., 1993) . The activity of the RNase domain is negatively regulated by the ARD, which is relieved upon binding of 2-5A molecules to ankyrin repeats 2 and 4 followed by a conformational alteration (Figure 1 ; Hassel et al., 1993; Tanaka et al., 2004; Nakanishi et al., 2005) . In support of this contention, deletion of the ARD has been demonstrated to produce constitutively active RNaseL, although with dramatically lower RNase activity (Dong and Silverman, 1997) . However, recent reports suggest that while 2-5A links the ankyrin repeats from adjacent molecules leading to formation of dimer and higher order structures, at sufficiently high in vitro concentrations, RNaseL could oligomerize even in the absence of 2-5A . Nonetheless, in vivo the RNaseL nuclease activity still seems to be under the sole regulation of 2-5A (Al-Saif and Khabar, 2012) . In order to exploit this dependence, multiple viruses like mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and rotavirus group A (RVA) have evolved to encode phosphodiesterases capable of hydrolysing the 2 -5 linkages in 2-5A and thereby attenuate the RNaseL cleavage activity (Zhao et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2013) . In addition to 5 -phosphatases and 2 -phosphodiesterases to reduce ClustalW alignment of primary sequence from a segment of the PK domain indicating amino acid residues which are important for interacting with nucleotide cofactors. The conserved lysine residues, critical for this interaction (K599 for IRE1 and K392 in RNaseL) are underlined. (C) Alignment of the KEN domains in RNaseL and IRE1. The amino acids highlighted and numbered in IRE1 are critical for the IRE1 RNase activity (Tirasophon et al., 2000) .\\n\\nthe endogenous 2-5A levels, mammalian genomes encode posttranscriptional and post-translation inhibitors of RNaseL activity in the form of microRNA-29 and the protein ABCE1 (RNaseL inhibitor or RLI), respectively (Bisbal et al., 1995; Lee et al., 2013) . Direct inhibition of RNaseL function is also observed upon infection by Picornaviruses through, either inducing the expression of ABCE1 or exercising a unique inhibitory property of a segment of the viral RNA (Martinand et al., 1998 (Martinand et al., , 1999 Townsend et al., 2008; Sorgeloos et al., 2013) .\\n\\nOnce activated by 2-5A, RNaseL can degrade single-stranded RNA irrespective of its origin (virus or host) although there seems to exist a bias towards cleavage of viral RNA (Wreschner et al., 1981a; Silverman et al., 1983; Li et al., 1998) . RNA sequences that are predominantly cleaved by RNaseL are U-rich with the cleavage points being typically at the 3 end of UA or UG or UU di-nucleotides, leaving a 5 -OH and a 3 -monophosphate in the cleavage product (Floyd-Smith et al., 1981; Wreschner et al., 1981b) . A recent report shows a more general consensus of 5 -UNN-3 with the cleavage point between the second and the third nucleotide (Han et al., 2014) . Cellular targets of RNaseL include both ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and mRNAs, the latter predominantly representing genes involved in protein biosynthesis (Wreschner et al., 1981a; Al-Ahmadi et al., 2009; Andersen et al., 2009) . Additionally, RNaseL activity can also degrade specific ISG mRNA transcripts and thereby attenuate the effect of IFN signaling (Li et al., 2000) . Probably an evolution towards insulating gene expression from RNaseL activity is observed in the coding region of mammalian genes where the UU/UA dinucleotide frequency is rarer (Bisbal et al., 2000; Khabar et al., 2003; Al-Saif and Khabar, 2012) . Perhaps not surprisingly, with a much faster rate of evolution, similar observations have been made with respect to evasion of RNaseL mediated degradation by viral RNAs too (Han and Barton, 2002; Washenberger et al., 2007) . Moreover, nucleoside modifications in host mRNAs, rarely observed in viral RNAs, have also been shown to confer protection from RNaseL (Anderson et al., 2011) . In addition to directly targeting viral RNA, the reduction in functional ribosomes and ribosomal protein mRNA affects viral protein synthesis and replication in an indirect manner. Probably, as a reflection of these effects on cellular RNAs, RNaseL is implicated as one of the factors determining the anti-proliferative effect of IFN activity . The anti-viral activity of RNaseL extends beyond direct cleavage of viral RNA, through stimulation of RIG-I by the cleavage product (Malathi et al., , 2007 (Malathi et al., , 2010 . A global effect of RNaseL is observed in the form of autophagy induced through c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling and apoptosis, probably as a consequence of rRNA cleavage (Li et al., 2004; Chakrabarti et al., 2012; Siddiqui and Malathi, 2012) . RNaseL has also been demonstrated to play a role in apoptotic cell death initiated by pharmacological agents extending the physiological role of this pathway beyond the boundary of being only an anti-viral mechanism (Castelli et al., 1997 (Castelli et al., , 1998 .\\n\\nThe ER serves as a conduit for maturation of cellular proteins which are either secreted or destined to be associated with a membrane for its function. An exclusive microenvironment (high Calcium ion and unique ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione) along with a battery of ER-lumen resident enzymes (foldases, chaperones, and lectins) catalyse/mediate the necessary folding, disulfide-bond formation, and glycosylation reactions (Schroder and Kaufman, 2005) . A perturbation of the folding capacity, due to either physiological disturbances or virus infection, can lead to an accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER lumen, which signals an unfolded protein response (UPR). UPR encompasses a networked transcriptional and translational gene-expression program, initiated by three ER-membrane resident sensors namely IRE1 or ERN1, PKR-like ER Kinase (PERK or EIF2AK3) and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6; Hetz, 2012) . IRE1 is a type I single-pass trans-membrane protein in which, similar to what is observed with RNaseL, the N-terminal resident in the ER lumen serves as sensor and the cytosolic C-terminal as the effector (Figure 1 ; Chen and Brandizzi, 2013) . The IRE1 coding gene is present in genomes ranging from yeast to mammals and in the latter is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues (Tirasophon et al., 1998) . Signal transduction by stimulated IRE1 initiates multiple gene regulatory pathways with either pro-survival or pro-apoptotic consequences (Kaufman, 1999) . During homeostasis or unstressed conditions the sensor molecules are monomeric, a state maintained co-operatively by the \" absence\" of unfolded proteins and the \"presence\" of HSPA5 (GRP78 or Bip, an ERresident chaperone) molecules bound to a membrane-proximal disordered segment of the protein in the ER-lumen-resident Nterminus (Credle et al., 2005) . Accumulated unfolded proteins in the lumen triggers coupling of this domain from adjacent sensor molecules through a combination of (a) titration of the bound HSPA5 chaperone molecules and (b) direct tethering by malfolded protein molecules (Shamu and Walter, 1996; Credle et al., 2005; Aragon et al., 2009; Korennykh et al., 2009) . Abutting of the luminal domains juxtapose the cytosolic C-terminal segments, leading to an aggregation of the IRE1 molecules into distinct ER-membrane foci (Kimata et al., 2007; Li et al., 2010) . The C-terminal segment has a serine/threonine kinase domain and a RNase domain homologous to that of RNaseL (Figure 1 ; Tirasophon et al., 1998 Tirasophon et al., , 2000 . A trans-autophosphorylation by the kinase domain allosterically activates the RNase domain (Tirasophon et al., 2000; Lee et al., 2008; Korennykh et al., 2009) . In fact, exogenous over-expression of IRE1 in mammalian cells lead to activation suggesting that, under homeostatic conditions, the non-juxtaposition of cytosolic domains maintains an inactive IRE1 (Tirasophon et al., 1998) . Once activated, IRE1 performs cleavage of a variety of RNA substrates mediated by its RNase domain, in addition to phosphorylating and thereby activating JNK (Cox and Walter, 1996; Urano et al., 2000) . Depending on the RNA substrate, the cleavage catalyzed by IRE1 RNase produces differential consequence. Although scission of the Xbp1 mRNA transcript at two internal positions is followed by splicing of the internal segment through ligation of the terminal cleavage products, that in all other known IRE1 target RNA is followed by degradation (Figure 1 ; Sidrauski and Walter, 1997; Calfon et al., 2002) . The latter mode of negative regulation of gene expression is termed as the regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD) pathway (Hollien and Weissman, 2006; Oikawa et al., 2007; Iqbal et al., 2008; Lipson et al., 2008) . Gene transcripts regulated by RIDD pathway includes that from IRE1 (i.e., selftranscripts), probably in a negative feedback loop mechanism (Tirasophon et al., 2000) . In addition to protein coding RNA, RIDD pathway down-regulates the level of a host of microRNA precursors (pre-miRNAs) and can potentially cleave in the anticodon loop of tRNA Phe (Korennykh et al., 2011; Upton et al., 2012) .\\n\\nThe IRE1 RNase domain cleaves the Xbp1u (u for unspliced) mRNA transcript at two precise internal positions within the open reading frame (ORF) generating three segments, the terminal two of which are ligated by a tRNA ligase in yeast and by an unknown ligase in mammalian cells, to produce the Xbp1s (s for spliced) mRNA transcript (Figure 1 ; Yoshida et al., 2001) . The Xbp1s thus generated has a longer ORF, which is created by a frame-shift in the coding sequence downstream of the splice site (Cox and Walter, 1996; Calfon et al., 2002) . A similar dual endonucleolytic cleavage is also observed to initiate the XRN1 and Ski2-3-8 dependent degradation of transcripts in the RIDD degradation pathway (Hollien and Weissman, 2006) . The RIDD target transcript genes are predominantly those that encode membrane-associated or secretory proteins and which are not necessary for ER proteinfolding reactions (Hollien and Weissman, 2006) . The cleavage of Xbp1 and the RIDD-target transcripts constitute homeostatic or pro-survival response by IRE1 since XBP1S trans-activates genes encoding multiple chaperones (to fold unfolded proteins) and the ERAD pathway genes (to degrade terminally misfolded proteins) whereas RIDD reduces flux of polypeptides entering the ER lumen (Lee et al., 2003; Hollien and Weissman, 2006) . On the other hand, cleavage of pre-miRNA transcripts which are processed in the cell to generate CASPASE-2 mRNA (Casp2) controlling miRNAs, constitutes the pro-apoptotic function of IRE1 (Upton et al., 2012) . Another pro-apoptotic signal from IRE1 emanates from signaling through phosphorylation of JNK1 (Urano et al., 2000) . Although in the initial phase RIDD activity does not cleave mRNAs encoding essential ER proteins, at later stages of chronic UPR such transcripts are rendered susceptible to degradation promoting apoptosis induction (Han et al., 2009; Bhattacharyya et al., 2014) .\\n\\nInfection of mammalian cells by a multitude of viruses induce an UPR which is sometimes characterized by suppression of signaling by one or more of the three sensor(s; Su et al., 2002; Tardif et al., 2002; He, 2006; Yu et al., 2006 Yu et al., , 2013 Medigeshi et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2010; Merquiol et al., 2011) . Among these at least two viruses from diverse families, HCMV (a DNA virus) and hepatitis C virus (a hepacivirus), interfere with IRE1 signaling by different mechanism (Tardif et al., 2004; Stahl et al., 2013 ). An observed inhibition of any cellular function by a virus infection could suggest a potential anti-virus function for it, which the virus has evolved to evade through blocking some critical step(s). In both the cases mentioned above, stability of the viral proteins seems to be affected by ERAD-mediated degradation, although other potential anti-viral effect of IRE1 activation are not clear yet (Isler et al., 2005; Saeed et al., 2011) . Interestingly, host mRNA fragments produced following IRE1 activation during bacterial infection, has been shown to activate RIG-I signaling (Figure 1 ; Cho et al., 2013b) . Theoretically, other functions of IRE1 can also have anti-viral effect necessitating its inhibition for uninhibited viral replication. It is, however, still not clear whether IRE1 is able to cleave any viral RNA (or mRNA) in a manner similar to that of other RIDD targets (Figure 1) . The possibilities of such a direct anti-viral function are encouraged by the fact that all these viruses encode at least one protein which, as part of its maturation process, requires glycosylation and disulfide-bond formation. Such a necessity would entail translation of the mRNA encoding such a protein, which in case of positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses would mean the genome, in association with the ER-membrane (Figure 1 ; Lerner et al., 2003) . Additionally for many RNA viruses, replication complexes are housed in ER-derived vesicular structures (Denison, 2008; den Boon et al., 2010) . Considering the proximity of IRE1 and these virus-derived RNAs it is tempting to speculate that probably at some point of time in the viral life cycle one or more virus-associated RNA would be susceptible to cleavage by IRE1. However, studies with at least two viruses have shown that instead of increasing viral titre, inhibiting the RNase activity of activated IRE1 has an opposite effect (Hassan et al., 2012; Bhattacharyya et al., 2014) . This implies potential benefits of IRE1 activation through one or more of the following, (a) expression of chaperones or other pro-viral molecules downstream of XBP1Supregulation or JNK-activation, (b) cleavage of potential anti-viral gene mRNA transcripts by RIDD activity. However, the mode of protection for the viral RNA from RIDD activity is still not clear. It is possible that the viral proteins create a subdomain within the ER membrane, which through some mechanism excludes IRE1 from diffusing near the genomic RNA, thereby protecting the replication complexes (Denison, 2008) . It is therefore probably not surprising that single-stranded plus-sense RNA viruses encode a polyprotein, which produces replication complexes in cis, promoting formation of such subdomains (Egger et al., 2000) . The fact that IRE1 forms bulky oligomers of higher order probably aggravates such an exclusion of the activated sensor molecules from vicinity of the viral replication complexes. The UPR signaling eventually attenuate during chronic ER-stress and since that is what a virus-induced UPR mimics, probably the viral RNA needs protection only during the initial phase of UPR activation (Lin et al., 2007) . Since the choice of RIDD target seems to be grossly driven towards mRNAs that encode ER-transitory but are not ER-essential proteins, it is also possible that one or more viral protein have evolved to mimic a host protein the transcript of which is RIDD-resistant (Hollien and Weissman, 2006) . Most of the RIDD target mRNA are observed to be ER-membrane associated, the proximity to IRE1 facilitating association and cleavage (Figure 1 ; Hollien and Weissman, 2006) . Although ER-association for an mRNA is possible without the mediation of ribosomes, Gaddam and co-workers reported that continued association with polysomes for a membrane-bound mRNA can confer protection from IRE1 cleavage (Cui et al., 2012; Gaddam et al., 2013) . This would suggest important implications for the observed refractory nature of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and influenza virus RNA to RIDD cleavage (Hassan et al., 2012; Bhattacharyya et al., 2014) . In contrast to Influenza virus, flaviviruses (which include JEV) do not suppress host protein synthesis implying the absence of a global inhibition on translation as would be expected during UPR (Clyde et al., 2006; Edgil et al., 2006) . Therefore, a continued translation of viral RNA in spite of UPR activation can in principle confer protection from the pattern of RNA cleavage observed in the RIDD pathway.\\n\\nIRE1 and RNaseL, in addition to biochemical similarities in protein kinase domain and structural similarities in their RNase domain, share the functional consequences of their activation in initiating cellular apoptosis through JNK signaling (Table 1 and Figure 2 ; Liu and Lin, 2005; Dhanasekaran and Reddy, 2008) . Though initial discoveries were made in the context of homeostatic and anti-viral role for the former and latter, differences between the pathways are narrowed by further advances in research. In the same vein, while inhibition of IRE1 signaling in virus infected cells indicates a potential anti-viral role, www.frontiersin.org (Tirasophon et al., 1998; Dong and Silverman, 1999; Papa et al., 2003; Lin et al., 2007) Nature of RNase substrates Both 28S rRNA and mRNAs IRE1β can cleave both 28S rRNA and mRNA while IRE1α substrates include only mRNAs (Iwawaki et al., 2001) Dissimilarities\\n\\nCleavage substrates Beside 28S rRNA, predominantly cleaves mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins (Andersen et al., 2009) Xbp1u and other mRNAs in addition to microRNA precursors which are targeted as part of the RIDD pathway Selection of cleavage site Cleaved between 2nd and 3rd nucleotide positions of UN/N sites (Han et al., 2014) RNA sequence with the consensus of 5 -CUGCAG-3 in association with a stem-loop (SL) structure essential for recognition of Xbp1u and other mRNAs (Oikawa et al., 2010) association of RNaseL mutations with generation of prostate cancer extends the ambit of influence of this anti-viral effector to more non-infectious physiological disorders (Silverman, 2003) . Biochemically, the similarity in their RNase domains does not extend to the choice of either substrates or cleavage point, which are downstream of UU or UA in RNaseL and downstream of G (predominantly) for IRE1 ( Figure 2C ; Yoshida et al., 2001; Hollien and Weissman, 2006; Upton et al., 2012) . Further, while RNaseL cleaves pre-dominantly in single-stranded region, IRE1 seems to cleave equally well in single-and double-stranded region (Upton et al., 2012) . However, a recent report suggested a consensus cleavage site with the sequence UN/N, in RNaseL targets and in those mRNAs that are cleaved by IRE1 as part of the RIDD pathway (Han et al., 2014) . Access to potential cleavage substrate for RNaseL is conjectured to be facilitated through its association with polyribosomes, while no such association is known for IRE1 (Salehzada et al., 1991) . Possibilities exist that IRE1 would have preferential distribution in the rough ER which, upon activation, would give it ready access to mRNAs for initiating the RIDD pathway.\\n\\nIn the context of a virus infection, the pathway leading from both these proteins have the potential to lead to cell death. Notwithstanding the fact that this might be an efficient way of virus clearance, it also portends pathological outcomes for the infected organism. Future research would probably lead to design of drugs targeting these proteins based on the structural homology of their effector domains, regulating the pathological denouement of their activation without compromising their anti-viral or potential anti-viral functions.'}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '2c53b0d84fbfb3ae5ec65cd340704234'}>,\n",

In this study, microRNA, mRNA and cytokine/chemokine secretion profiling were investigated for human monocyte-derived macrophages infected in-vitro with Influenza virus A/H1N1 and/or Streptococcus pneumoniae. We observed that the in-vitro co-infection synergistically increased interferon-γ-induced protein-10 (CXCL10, IP-10) expression compared to the singly-infected cells conditions. We demonstrated that endogenous miRNA-200a-3p, whose expression was synergistically induced following co-infection, indirectly regulates CXCL10 expression by targeting suppressor of cytokine signaling-6 (SOCS-6), a well-known regulator of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Additionally, in a subsequent clinical pilot study, immunomodulators levels were evaluated in samples from 74 children (≤5 years-old) hospitalized with viral and/or bacterial community-acquired pneumonia. Clinically, among the 74 cases of pneumonia, patients with identified mixed-detection had significantly higher (3.6-fold) serum IP-10 levels than those with a single detection (P = 0.03), and were significantly associated with severe pneumonia (P < 0.01). This study demonstrates that viral and bacterial co-infection modulates the JAK-STAT signaling pathway and leads to exacerbated IP-10 expression, which could play a major role in the pathogenesis of pneumonia.\\n\\nText: Scientific RepoRts | 6:38532 | DOI: 10 .1038/srep38532 pathogenesis of several diseases and has been suggested as a potential biomarker of viral infection 10, 11 , late-onset bacterial infection in premature infants 12 , and a promising biomarker of sepsis and septic shock 13, 14 . Combined analysis of IP-10 and IFN-γ has also been reported as a useful biomarker for diagnosis and monitoring therapeutic efficacy in patients with active tuberculosis [15] [16] [17] , and both remain detectable in the urine of patients with pulmonary diseases in the absence of renal dysfunction 18 .\\n\\nWith airway epithelial cells 19 , resident alveolar macrophages (AMs) and blood monocytes-derived macrophages (recruited into tissues under inflammatory conditions 20, 21 ) represent a major line of defense against both pneumococcal (through their high phagocytic capacity [22] [23] [24] ) and influenza infection 25, 26 . So far, no studies have yet focused on the intracellular mechanisms that regulate IP-10 in human blood leukocytes during mixed IAV and SP infection. Several studies indicated that host non-coding small RNAs (including microRNAs) may function as immunomodulators by regulating several pivotal intracellular processes, such as the innate immune response 27 and antiviral activity 28, 29 ; both of these processes are closely related to toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways.\\n\\nIn this study, we firstly investigated the in vitro intracellular mechanisms that mediate the innate immune response in IAV and/or SP infected human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). Using this approach, we observed that mixed-infection of MDMs induces a synergistic production of IP-10 which can be related to a miRNA-200a/JAK-STAT/SOCS-6 regulatory pathway. Subsequently, in a retrospective analysis of clinical samples collected from children ≤ 5 years-old hospitalized with pneumonia, we confirmed that serum IP-10 level could be related to both viral and/or bacterial etiologies and disease severity.\\n\\nCharacteristics of MDMs infected by IAV and/or SP. Initially, we investigated in vitro the impact of single and mixed IAV and SP infection on MDMs. Firstly, active replication of IAV was assessed by qRT-PCR and quantification of new infectious viral particles in the cell supernatants ( Fig. 1a,b ). IAV titer increased over time after single infection with IAV and correlated with increased production of negative-strand IAV RNA. Maximum viral replication was observed at 18-24 hours post-infection, after which time both RNA replication and the quantity of infectious particles decreased. In this in vitro model, subsequent challenge of IAV-infected MDMs with SP had no significant impact on the production of new infectious viral particles (Fig. 1b) . Together, these results indicate permissive and productive infection of MDMs by IAV. Secondly, we evaluated whether MDMs are permissive for both IAV and SP infection. The presence of pneumococci within IAV-and SP-infected primary MDMs was confirmed at 8 h post-infection (Fig. 1c) , suggesting that MDMs are permissive for viral and bacterial co-infection in the early steps of infection. Importantly, confocal co-detection of mixed IAV and SP was only effective following 8 h post-infection due to the bactericidal impact of SP internalization within human macrophages (after 24 h, data not shown). Thirdly, we evaluated the impact of single and mixed infection with IAV and SP on MDM viability. Mixed infection significantly decreased cell viability (65.2 ± 4.5% total cell death at 48 hours post-infection; P < 0.0001) compared to single SP and IAV infection (39.6 ± 1.7% and 17.4 ± 1.1% total cell death, respectively; Fig. 1d ). Taken together, these results confirmed human MDMs are permissive to mixed viral and bacterial infection. mRNA, microRNA and protein expression profiling reveal an overall induction of the host innate immune response following IAV and/or SP infection of MDMs. To investigate the innate immune response orchestrated by IAV-and SP-infected human MDMs, we firstly evaluated the expression of 84 genes involved in the innate and adaptive immune responses (Table S1) ; the major differentially-expressed genes are summarized in Fig. 2a . Expression profiling indicated an overall induction of genes related to the JAK-STAT, NF-Κ β and TLR signaling pathways. Indeed, all interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) screened, including CXCL10 (fold-change [FC] = 240.9), CCL-2 (FC = 34.2) and MX-1 (FC = 151.4) were upregulated following mixed infection compared to uninfected cells, most of which are closely related to STAT-1 (FC = 52.3), IRF-7 (FC = 6.8) and IFNB1 (FC = 5.2) also found upregulated in mixed infected cells. Secondly, we investigated the endogenous microRNA expression profiles of IAV-and SP-infected MDMs. A selection of microRNAs that were found to be differentially-expressed under different infection conditions are shown in Fig. 2b and Table S2 . MiRNA-200a-3p was overexpressed after both single IAV (FC = 6.9), single SP (FC = 3.7) and mixed IAV/SP infection (FC = 7.3), indicating this miRNA may play a role in the innate immune response to viral and bacterial co-infection. Similar miRNA-200a-3p dysregulation profiles were obtained following IAV and/or SP infections of human macrophages-like (THP-1 monocytes-derived macrophages) or primary MDMs (data not shown). Thirdly, the secreted levels of various antiviral, pro-inflammatory and immunomodulatory cytokines/chemokines were assayed in IAV-and SP-infected-THP-1 and primary MDM cell supernatants. We observed a remarkable correlation between the mRNA and protein expression profiles of single or mixed infected MDMs especially regarding CXCL-10 and IP-10 expression. Indeed, the level of IP-10 was synergistically increased in the supernatant of IAV-infected THP-1 MDMs exposed to SP (mean: 30,589 ± 16,484 pg ml −1 ) compared to single IAV infection (1,439 ± 566.5 pg ml −1 ) and single SP infection (4,472 ± 2,001 pg ml −1 ; P≤ 0.05; Fig. 2c ) at 24 hours after infection. In those cells, IP-10 expression reduced over time (48 to 72 hours), coinciding with a significant higher proportion of necrotic and apoptotic cells (Fig. 1d) . The synergistic expression of IP-10 was similarly observed at 24 hours post-infection using primary MDMs (Fig. 2d) . Significantly increased secretion of the other tested cytokines and chemokines was not observed post-infection, even in mixed infected MDMs (Fig. S1 ). Interestingly, a significant production of IP-10 was also observed in supernatants of primary human airway epithelial cells (HAEC) mixed-infected by IAV and SP compared to the single infections (Fig. 2e) . Taken together, the mRNA and protein profiling results suggested that mixed viral and bacterial infection of MDMs induces a synergistic pro-inflammatory response related to the type-1 interferon and JAK-STAT signaling pathways, with IP-10 as signature of IAV/SP co-infection. Among all microRNAs screened, miR-200a-3p was the most Scientific RepoRts | 6:38532 | DOI: 10.1038/srep38532 overexpressed in IAV/SP co-infection of human MDMs. In the remainder of this study, we decided to investigate the interconnection between miR-200a-3p expression and the innate immune response.\\n\\nEndogenous miRNA-200a-3p expression correlates with CXCL10 (IP-10) induction following mixed IAV and SP infection of human MDMs. Using a specific Taqman probe assay targeting miR-200a-3p, we confirmed a significant upregulation of miR-200a-3p following mixed IAV and SP infection of human MDMs (Fig. 3a) . In this experiment, a more marked up-regulation of miR-200a-3p was observed following IAV+ SP compared to results obtained previously (Fig. 2b) . This discrepancy has been attributed to the use of two different approaches to quantify miR-200a-3p expression. The use of a target-specific stem-loop reverse transcription primer in Fig. 3a allows a better sensitivity of miR-200a-3p detection compared to the non-specific fluorescent dye used in Fig. 2b . As the general trend was suggestive of a synergistic induction of miR-200a-3p in response to mixed infection (Fig. 3a) , we hypothesized microRNA-200a-3p may play a role in the regulation of CXCL10 (IP-10), which was also synergistically upregulated in mixed-infected MDMs ( Fig. 2c and d) and primary HAEC ( Statistical analyses were performed using two-way ANOVA with Tukey\\'s post-hoc test; *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001.\\n\\nScientific RepoRts | 6:38532 | DOI: 10.1038/srep38532 CXCL10 (Fig. 3d) . These results suggested miR-200a-3p indirectly regulates CXCL10 and led us to hypothesize that miR-200a-3p controls a potential repressor of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. . At 18 h after transfection, the MDMs were singly or mixed infected as described previously. At 8 h post-IAV and/or SP infection, total mRNA was extracted and amplified by PCR using specific primers for the indicated genes. Values represent median ± IQR (a, c) or mean ± SEM (d, e) of three biological replicates. Statistical analyses were performed using a Kruskal-Wallis test (non-parametric, one-way ANOVA with Dunn\\'s post-hoc test) for data presented in (a, c). An ordinary two-way ANOVA (with Tukey\\'s post-hoc multiple comparison test) was used for data presented in (d, e). *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001. MiRNA-200a-3p indirectly regulates IP-10 expression by targeting SOCS6. As shown in Fig. 2a , several JAK-STAT signaling pathway genes were deregulated in mixed IAV-and SP-infected human MDMs; therefore, we hypothesized that miR-200a-3p directly regulates a regulator of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Predictive target analysis indicated that the 3\\' UTR of suppressor of cytokine signaling-6 (SOCS6) may be targeted by miR-200a-3p (Fig. 3b) . SOCS proteins constitute a class of negative regulators of JAK-STAT signaling pathways that are induced by both cytokines and TLR signaling. MiRNA-200a-3p was not predicted to target any of the other six members of the SOCS gene family. Transfection of human MDMs with MIM-200a downregulated SOCS6 (FC = 0.57) while inhibition of miR-200a-3p (INH-200a) upregulated SOCS6 (FC = 1.55), confirming that miR-200a-3p effectively regulates the expression of SOCS6 (Fig. 3e) . Moreover, SOCS6 was synergistically downregulated in IAV-or IAV/SP-infected MDMs overexpressing miRNA-200a (Fig. 3e) , suggesting that both infection and miR-200a-3p negatively regulate the expression of SOCS6. Finally, western blotting confirmed that expression of SOCS-6 sharply reduced following infection, especially after mixed IAV and SP infection (Fig. 3f) .\\n\\nThese results indicate miR-200a-3p is strongly induced in response to mixed viral and bacterial co-infection, which in turn leads to downregulation of the JAK-STAT regulator SOCS-6 at both the mRNA and protein levels and subsequent upregulation of IP-10.\\n\\nanalyses demonstrated mixed IAV and SP infection of human MDMs and HAEC induced significant production of IP-10. As blood leukocytes and respiratory tract epithelial cells actively contribute to inflammation during pneumonia, we hypothesized the level of IP-10 in serum of patient with pneumonia may be both indicative of mixed respiratory infection and disease severity. As part of a prospective, hospital-based, multicenter case-control study on the etiology of pneumonia among children under 5-years-old, a total of 74 patients (44 male, 30 female) were included in this pilot evaluation. According to WHO guidelines, retrospective analysis indicated 44 (59.5%) children had clinical signs of non-severe pneumonia and 30 (40.5%) children had signs of severe pneumonia. The main patient characteristics at inclusion are shown in Table 1 . Patients with severe pneumonia had significant more recorded episodes of dyspnea (P < 0.001), cyanosis (P = 0.03), lower chest indrawing (P < 0.001), dullness to percussion (P < 0.001) and lethargy (P < 0.001) during chest examination than patient with non-severe pneumonia. Moreover, pleural effusions were significantly more observed among critically ill patients and the duration of hospitalization was significantly longer for the children with severe pneumonia than for those with non-severe pneumonia (P = 0.0015). Two deaths occurred within the group of children retrospectively defined with severe pneumonia. Evaluation of the systemic inflammatory response of the 74 cases is shown in Table 2 . Serum level of CRP, IP-10, PCT, G-CSF, IL-6, IL-8 and MIP-1β were significantly more elevated in serum samples from critically ill patients. Patients with severe pneumonia had significantly higher (4.2-fold) serum IP-10 levels than those with a non-severe pneumonia (P < 0.001) suggesting IP-10 as a promising prognostic marker in pneumonia. Diagnostic accuracy measures for predicting pneumonia severity using blood-based biomarkers are summarized in Table S3 . Briefly, in this study, the optimal IP-10 cut-off value for identifying patient with severe pneumonia was 4,240 pg ml −1 , with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.69 (95% CI, 0.57 to 0.82, P < 0.001). Defining as positive a serum IP-10 level above this cut-off resulted in a sensitivity of 63.3%, specificity of 63.6% and a positive likelihood ratio of 1.74. Prognostic values of IP-10 were closed to procalcitonin (PCT; AUC = 0.70; 95% IC, 0.58 to 0.82, P < 0.001) and IL-6 (AUC = 0.70; 95% IC, 0.58-0.83, P < 0.001).\\n\\nMultiplex PCR-based screening of respiratory and blood samples reveal a high variety of pathogen associations (Table 3) . Respiratory viruses were detected in the nasal aspirates (NAs) of 63/74 patients (85.1%). Etiological bacteria of pneumonia (S. pneumoniae, n = 19; S. aureus, n = 1; or H. influenzae type B, n = 7) were identified via real-time PCR in the blood samples of 27/74 (36.5%) of the patients. Multiplex PCR assays allowed the identification of respiratory bacteria in the blood of 19 patients with negative blood culture results. Among the 74 cases PCR-positive for respiratory pathogens, a single virus or bacteria were detected in the NAs of 7 (9.4%) and 3 (4.0%) patients, respectively; these 10/74 (13.5%) cases were defined as the single infection group. The mixed infection group included the 62/74 (83.8%) cases in which (1) multiple viruses and/or bacteria were identified in NAs (38/74; 51.3%) without any bacteria identified in blood samples or (2) one or more viruses and/or bacteria were identified in NAs and associated with a blood bacteremia (24/74; 32.4%). We evaluated whether IP-10 serum level could correlate with the viral and bacterial etiologies of pneumonia. Patients with mixed infection had significant higher (3.6-fold) IP-10 serum level than patient with single detection (P = 0.03; Table 4 ). A stratified analysis reveals that the highest IP-10 serum level was observed among patients with both several respiratory pathogens identified (mixed-detection group) and severe pneumonia (14,427 pg ml −1 , IQR (3,981-82,994). In detail, a remarkable IP-10 serum level (142,531 pg ml −1 ), representing 33-fold higher above cut-off value predicting pneumonia severity was observed in patient with hRV in NA co-detected with S. pneumoniae (serotype 14) in pleural effusion and blood. In concordance with our in-vitro model of co-infection, a significant IP-10 level (90,338 pg ml −1 ) was quantified in blood sample of patient with severe bacteremic pneumococcal (serotype 14) pneumonia with a positive co-detection of Influenza B virus in NA. Taken together, these results suggest that high serum IP-10 levels are significantly associated with mixed viral and bacterial detection and also related to pneumonia pathogenesis.\\n\\nThis study provides additional in vitro and clinical data to improve our understanding of the immunopathology of mixed viral and bacterial pneumonia (Fig. 4) .\\n\\nThe in vitro model of influenza and pneumococcal superinfection of human MDMs demonstrated that mixed infection synergistically induced release of the pro-inflammatory chemokine IP-10, strongly suggesting human Scientific RepoRts | 6:38532 | DOI: 10.1038/srep38532 blood leukocytes contribute to the immunopathology of pneumonia. Additionally, transcriptomics and omics analyses provided new data on the inflammatory pathways that are activated during mixed infection and related to synergistic induction of the pro-inflammatory chemokine IP-10 in mixed infected cells. Our observations are consistent with a recent study describing IP-10 induction as host-proteome signature of both viral and bacterial infections 30 . Of the differentially-expressed genes observed in mixed infected MDMs, the transcription factors STAT-1 and IRF-7 appear to play crucial roles in the regulation of interferon-stimulated genes including CXCL10 (IP-10). By focusing on the intracellular mechanisms that regulate inflammatory pathways, we demonstrated a novel role for miRNA-200a-3p in the regulation of CXCL10 (IP-10). These observations are consistent with previous reports showing that RNA virus infection upregulates miR-155 in macrophages and dendritic cells and also regulates suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1), suggesting the existence of a miRNA/JAK-STAT/SOCS regulatory pathway during viral infection 29 . Our study suggests co-infection leads to overexpression of miR-200a-3p, which in turn targets and downregulates the JAK-STAT regulator SOCS-6 and consequently increases CXCL10 (IP-10) expression. Interestingly, a complementary in-silico approach reveals that several microRNAs that were found dysregulated in our experiments of IAV and SP co-infection of MDMs or HAEC, might target several genes of SOCS family and play similar role than miR-200a-3p. Indeed, miRNA-142-3p might target SOCS4, 5, 6 mRNA while miRNA-194-5p might target SOCS2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 mRNA. These observations underline that intra-cellular regulation of IP-10 is not limited to the contribution of a sole microRNA. A complex inter-relationship between numerous host microRNAs and inhibitors of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway occur to control host innate inflammatory response against viral and/or bacterial infections. Clinically, the majority of pediatric CAP cases in this study were associated with both positive viral and/or bacterial detection. Respiratory microorganisms were detected in 97% of cases; 51.3% of which were viral-viral, viral-bacterial or bacterial-bacterial co-detected only in nasal aspirates, 32.4% of which co-detected in both nasal aspirates and blood samples. These data are consistent with previous etiological studies of pediatric CAP 3,31-33 . S. pneumoniae was the major bacteria identified in blood (19/74; 25.7%) and mainly co-detected with respiratory viruses in NAs (16/19; 84.2%). We observed a very high diversity of viral and bacterial associations in biological samples from children with pneumonia. In comparison with IAV and SP14 combination evaluated in-vitro, no pneumonia cases were singly influenza and pneumococcus infected, and no similar co-detection with those two pathogens has been clinically observed. Nevertheless, Influenza B (IVB) virus was identified in 5 patients and two of them had a positive SP co-detection in blood (one non-typable strain and one serotype 14 using our molecular typing test). IVB and SP14 combination seems to be the nearest pathogen co-detection to that in-vitro investigated. Clinically, this co-detection was associated with both a very high IP-10 expression and a very severe pneumonia case definition. Interestingly, our translational pilot evaluation reveals IP-10 expression can be induced by several different viral and/or bacterial combinations. As immune response to each pathogen is different, further in-vitro investigations using different pathogens associations are needed to better characterize the mechanisms involved in the immunopathology of pneumonia.\\n\\nIn this cohort, highest serum IP-10 levels were identified among patients with both several pathogen detected and severe pneumonia, suggesting a significant role of IP-10 on pneumonia pathogenesis. Indeed, high plasma levels of IP-10 have previously been reported in patients with sepsis 12 , and were associated with high mortality rate, especially among patients with CAP 34 . Additionally, the IP-10-CXCR3 axis has been related to acute immune lung injury and lymphocyte apoptosis during the development of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 35, 36 . Moreover, an in vivo study that modeled influenza and pneumococcal superinfection in mice indicated that pro-inflammatory chemokines, including IP-10, play a crucial role in influenza-induced susceptibility to lung neutrophilia, severe immunopathology and mortality 37 . In this study, markedly elevated IP-10 (92,809 pg ml −1 ) combined with the highest PCT level (74.4 pg ml −1 ) were quantified in the serum sample of a child who died, in whom S. pneumoniae (serotype 9 V) was identified in the blood (PCR and blood culture) and co-detected with Haemophilus influenzae type B in nasal aspirate. These observations suggest an interrelationship between co-detection, elevated serum IP-10 and the pathogenesis of pneumonia.\\n\\nSeveral limitations of this pilot translational study need to be acknowledged before concluding mixed infection is related to elevated IP-10 and disease severity. Indeed, although viral shedding (e.g., of HRV and HBoV) is common in asymptomatic children, we were unable to evaluate the levels of immunomodulators in the serum samples of a control group. Moreover, although the samples were collected within the first 24 hours after admission, only a single blood sample was processed for each patient. Therefore, a larger, longitudinal study on the etiology and severity of pneumonia will be necessary to confirm these results. In conclusion, the present findings suggest that mixed respiratory infections and IP-10 may play major, interconnected roles in the pathogenesis of pneumonia. Clinically, assessment and monitoring of induced IP-10 serum level may assist clinicians to improve diagnosis and patient management of severe community-acquired pneumonia.\\n\\nViral and bacterial strains.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the magnitude of mental health outcomes and associated factors among health care workers treating patients exposed to COVID-19 in China. DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional, survey-based, region-stratified study collected demographic data and mental health measurements from 1257 health care workers in 34 hospitals from January 29, 2020, to February 3, 2020, in China. Health care workers in hospitals equipped with fever clinics or wards for patients with COVID-19 were eligible. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The degree of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress was assessed by the Chinese versions of the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, the 7-item Insomnia Severity Index, and the 22-item Impact of Event Scale–Revised, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with mental health outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 1257 of 1830 contacted individuals completed the survey, with a participation rate of 68.7%. A total of 813 (64.7%) were aged 26 to 40 years, and 964 (76.7%) were women. Of all participants, 764 (60.8%) were nurses, and 493 (39.2%) were physicians; 760 (60.5%) worked in hospitals in Wuhan, and 522 (41.5%) were frontline health care workers. A considerable proportion of participants reported symptoms of depression (634 [50.4%]), anxiety (560 [44.6%]), insomnia (427 [34.0%]), and distress (899 [71.5%]). Nurses, women, frontline health care workers, and those working in Wuhan, China, reported more severe degrees of all measurements of mental health symptoms than other health care workers (eg, median [IQR] Patient Health Questionnaire scores among physicians vs nurses: 4.0 [1.0-7.0] vs 5.0 [2.0-8.0]; P = .007; median [interquartile range {IQR}] Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale scores among men vs women: 2.0 [0-6.0] vs 4.0 [1.0-7.0]; P < .001; median [IQR] Insomnia Severity Index scores among frontline vs second-line workers: 6.0 [2.0-11.0] vs 4.0 [1.0-8.0]; P < .001; median [IQR] Impact of Event Scale–Revised scores among those in Wuhan vs those in Hubei outside Wuhan and those outside Hubei: 21.0 [8.5-34.5] vs 18.0 [6.0-28.0] in Hubei outside Wuhan and 15.0 [4.0-26.0] outside Hubei; P < .001). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed participants from outside Hubei province were associated with lower risk of experiencing symptoms of distress compared with those in Wuhan (odds ratio [OR], 0.62; 95% CI, 0.43-0.88; P = .008). Frontline health care workers engaged in direct diagnosis, treatment, and care of patients with COVID-19 were associated with a higher risk of symptoms of depression (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.11-2.09; P = .01), anxiety (OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.22-2.02; P < .001), insomnia (OR, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.92-4.60; P < .001), and distress (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.25-2.04; P < .001).

Although apparently disadvantaged by their dependence on the host biosynthetic processes, an immensely faster rate of evolution provides viruses with an edge in this conflict. In this review, I have discussed the potential anti-virus activity of inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), a well characterized effector of the cellular homeostatic response to an overloading of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein-folding capacity. IRE1, an ER-membrane-resident ribonuclease (RNase), upon activation catalyses regulated cleavage of select protein-coding and non-coding host RNAs, using an RNase domain which is homologous to that of the known anti-viral effector RNaseL. The latter operates as part of the Oligoadenylate synthetase OAS/RNaseL system of anti-viral defense mechanism. Protein-coding RNA substrates are differentially treated by the IRE1 RNase to either augment, through cytoplasmic splicing of an intron in the Xbp1 transcript, or suppress gene expression. This referred suppression of gene expression is mediated through degradative cleavage of a select cohort of cellular RNA transcripts, initiating the regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD) pathway. The review first discusses the anti-viral mechanism of the OAS/RNaseL system and evasion tactics employed by different viruses. This is followed by a review of the RIDD pathway and its potential effect on the stability of viral RNAs. I conclude with a comparison of the enzymatic activity of the two RNases followed by deliberations on the physiological consequences of their activation.\\n\\nText: Establishment of infection by a virus, even in permissive host cells, is beset with a plethora of challenges from innate-antiviral and cell-death pathways. Therefore, the host response to a virus infection might prove to be inhibitory for the viral life cycle in a direct or an indirect manner. The direct mechanism involves expression of multiple anti-viral genes that have evolved to recognize, react, and thereby rid the infected host of the viral nucleic acid (Zhou et al., 1997; Thompson et al., 2011) . On the other hand the pathways, e.g., those that culminate in initiating an apoptotic death for the host cell, indirectly serve to limit the spread of virus (Roulston et al., 1999) . A major difference between these two mechanisms is that while the former response is transmissible to neighboring uninfected cells through interferon (IFN) signaling, the latter is observed mostly in cis. Recent reports, however, have demonstrated transmission of an apoptotic signal between cells that are in contact through gap junctions, although such a signaling from an virus infected host cell to an uninfected one is not known yet (Cusato et al., 2003; Udawatte and Ripps, 2005; Kameritsch et al., 2013) . Successful viral pathogens, through a process of active selection, have evolved to replicate and simultaneously evade or block either of these host responses. The viral nucleic acids which could be the genome (positive-sense singlestranded RNA virus) or RNA derived from transcription of the genome [negative-stranded single-sense RNA or double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) or DNA virus], offer critical targets for both detection and eradication. The viral nucleic acid targeting armaments in the host arsenal include those that recognize the associated molecular patterns like toll-like receptors (TLRs), DDX58 (or RIG-1), IFIH1 (or MDA5), IFIT proteins [IFN-stimulated genes (ISG)56 and ISF54], etc. (Aoshi et al., 2011; Bowzard et al., 2011; Jensen and Thomsen, 2012) . This is followed by IFN signaling and expression or activation of factors that target the inducer for degradation or modification like OAS/ribonuclease L (RNaseL) system, APOBEC3, MCPIP1, the ZC3HAV1/exosome system and RNAi pathways (Gao et al., 2002; Sheehy et al., 2002; Guo et al., 2007; Daffis et al., 2010; Sidahmed and Wilkie, 2010; Schmidt et al., 2012; Cho et al., 2013a; Lin et al., 2013) . In this review we focus on two proteins containing homologous RNase domains, RNaseL with a known direct antiviral function and Inositolrequiring enzyme 1 (IRE1 or ERN1) which has an RNaseL-like RNase domain with a known role in homeostatic response to unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and a potential to function as an antiviral (Figure 1 ; Tirasophon et al., 2000) .\\n\\nIn mammalian cells the tell-tale signs of RNA virus infection, like the presence of cytosolic RNA having 5 -ppp or extensive (>30 bp) dsRNA segments are detected by dedicated pathogen associated molecular pattern receptors (PAMPs) or pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in the host cell, like RIG-1, MDA5, and the IFIT family of proteins (Aoshi et al., 2011; Bowzard et al., 2011; Vabret and Blander, 2013) . The transduction of a signal of this recognition results in the expression of IFN genes the products www.frontiersin.org FIGURE 1 | Schematic representation of the ribonuclease activity of IRE1 and RNaseL showing cross-talk between the paths catalysed by the enzymes. The figure shows activation of RNase activity following dimerization triggered by either accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER-lumen or synthesis of 2-5A by the enzyme OAS, respectively, for IRE1 and RNaseL. The cleavage of Xbp1u by IRE1 releases an intron thus generating Xbp1s. The IRE1 targets in RIDD pathway or all RNaseL substrates are shown to undergo degradative cleavage. The cleavage products generated through degradation of the respective substrate is shown to potentially interact with RIG-I thereby leading to Interferon secretion and trans-activation of Oas genes through Interferon signaling.

The genes that are regulated as a result of IFN signaling are termed as IFN-stimulated or IFN-regulated genes (ISGs or IRGs; Sen and Sarkar, 2007; Schoggins and Rice, 2011) . Oligoadenylate synthetase or OAS genes are canonical ISGs that convert ATP into 2 -5 linked oligoadenylates (2-5A) by an unique enzymatic mechanism (Figure 1 ; Hartmann et al., 2003) . Further, they are RNA-binding proteins that function like PRRs, in a way that the 2-5A synthesizing activity needs to be induced through an interaction with dsRNA (Minks et al., 1979; Hartmann et al., 2003) . In a host cell infected by an RNA virus, such dsRNA is present in the form of replication-intermediates (RI), which are synthesized by the virus-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) and subsequently used by the same enzyme to synthesize more genomic RNA, through asymmetric transcription (Weber et al., 2006) . However, the replications complexes (RCs) harboring these RI molecules are found secluded inside host-membrane derived vesicles, at least in positive-strand RNA viruses, a group which contains many human pathogens (Uchil and Satchidanandam, 2003; Denison, 2008) . Reports from different groups suggest OAS proteins to be distributed both in the cytoplasm as well as in membrane-associated fractions, perhaps indicating an evolution of the host anti-viral methodologies towards detection of the membrane-associated viral dsRNAs (Marie et al., 1990; Lin et al., 2009) . DNA viruses on the other hand, produce dsRNA by annealing of RNA derived from transcription of both strands in the same viral genomic loci, which are probably detected by the cytoplasmic pool of OAS proteins (Jacobs and Langland, 1996; Weber et al., 2006) . Post-activation the OAS enzymes synthesize 2-5A molecules in a non-processive reaction producing oligomers which, although potentially ranging in size from dimeric to multimeric, are functionally active only in a trimeric or tetrameric form (Dong et al., 1994; Sarkar et al., 1999; Silverman, 2007) . These small ligands, which bear phosphate groups (1-3) at the 5 end and hydroxyl groups at the 2 and 3 positions, serve as co-factor which can specifically interact with and thereby allosterically activate, existing RNaseL molecules (Knight et al., 1980; Zhou et al., 1997 Zhou et al., , 2005 Sarkar et al., 1999) . As part of a physiological control system these 2-5A oligomers are quite unstable in that they are highly susceptible to degradation by cellular 5 -phosphatases and PDE12 (2 -phosphodiesterase; Silverman et al., 1981; Johnston and Hearl, 1987; Kubota et al., 2004; Schmidt et al., 2012) . Viral strategies to evade or overcome this host defense mechanism ranges from preventing IFN signaling which would hinder the induction of OAS expression or thwarting activation of expressed OAS proteins by either shielding the viral dsRNA from interacting with it or modulating the host pathway to synthesize inactive 2-5A derivatives (Cayley et al., 1984; Hersh et al., 1984; Rice et al., 1985; Maitra et al., 1994; Beattie et al., 1995; Rivas et al., 1998; Child et al., 2004; Min and Krug, 2006; Sanchez and Mohr, 2007; Sorgeloos et al., 2013) . Shielding of viral RNA from interacting with OAS is possible through enclosure of dsRNA replication intermediates in membrane enclosed compartments as observed in many flaviviruses (Ahlquist, 2006; Miller and Krijnse-Locker, 2008; Miorin et al., 2013) .\\n\\nRNaseL is a 741 amino acid protein containing three predominantly structured region, an N-terminal ankyrin repeat domain (ARD), a middle catalytically inactive pseudo-kinase (PK) and a C-terminal RNase domain (Figure 2A ; Hassel et al., 1993; Zhou et al., 1993) . The activity of the RNase domain is negatively regulated by the ARD, which is relieved upon binding of 2-5A molecules to ankyrin repeats 2 and 4 followed by a conformational alteration (Figure 1 ; Hassel et al., 1993; Tanaka et al., 2004; Nakanishi et al., 2005) . In support of this contention, deletion of the ARD has been demonstrated to produce constitutively active RNaseL, although with dramatically lower RNase activity (Dong and Silverman, 1997) . However, recent reports suggest that while 2-5A links the ankyrin repeats from adjacent molecules leading to formation of dimer and higher order structures, at sufficiently high in vitro concentrations, RNaseL could oligomerize even in the absence of 2-5A . Nonetheless, in vivo the RNaseL nuclease activity still seems to be under the sole regulation of 2-5A (Al-Saif and Khabar, 2012) . In order to exploit this dependence, multiple viruses like mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and rotavirus group A (RVA) have evolved to encode phosphodiesterases capable of hydrolysing the 2 -5 linkages in 2-5A and thereby attenuate the RNaseL cleavage activity (Zhao et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2013) . In addition to 5 -phosphatases and 2 -phosphodiesterases to reduce ClustalW alignment of primary sequence from a segment of the PK domain indicating amino acid residues which are important for interacting with nucleotide cofactors. The conserved lysine residues, critical for this interaction (K599 for IRE1 and K392 in RNaseL) are underlined. (C) Alignment of the KEN domains in RNaseL and IRE1. The amino acids highlighted and numbered in IRE1 are critical for the IRE1 RNase activity (Tirasophon et al., 2000) .\\n\\nthe endogenous 2-5A levels, mammalian genomes encode posttranscriptional and post-translation inhibitors of RNaseL activity in the form of microRNA-29 and the protein ABCE1 (RNaseL inhibitor or RLI), respectively (Bisbal et al., 1995; Lee et al., 2013) . Direct inhibition of RNaseL function is also observed upon infection by Picornaviruses through, either inducing the expression of ABCE1 or exercising a unique inhibitory property of a segment of the viral RNA (Martinand et al., 1998 (Martinand et al., , 1999 Townsend et al., 2008; Sorgeloos et al., 2013) .\\n\\nOnce activated by 2-5A, RNaseL can degrade single-stranded RNA irrespective of its origin (virus or host) although there seems to exist a bias towards cleavage of viral RNA (Wreschner et al., 1981a; Silverman et al., 1983; Li et al., 1998) . RNA sequences that are predominantly cleaved by RNaseL are U-rich with the cleavage points being typically at the 3 end of UA or UG or UU di-nucleotides, leaving a 5 -OH and a 3 -monophosphate in the cleavage product (Floyd-Smith et al., 1981; Wreschner et al., 1981b) . A recent report shows a more general consensus of 5 -UNN-3 with the cleavage point between the second and the third nucleotide (Han et al., 2014) . Cellular targets of RNaseL include both ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and mRNAs, the latter predominantly representing genes involved in protein biosynthesis (Wreschner et al., 1981a; Al-Ahmadi et al., 2009; Andersen et al., 2009) . Additionally, RNaseL activity can also degrade specific ISG mRNA transcripts and thereby attenuate the effect of IFN signaling (Li et al., 2000) . Probably an evolution towards insulating gene expression from RNaseL activity is observed in the coding region of mammalian genes where the UU/UA dinucleotide frequency is rarer (Bisbal et al., 2000; Khabar et al., 2003; Al-Saif and Khabar, 2012) . Perhaps not surprisingly, with a much faster rate of evolution, similar observations have been made with respect to evasion of RNaseL mediated degradation by viral RNAs too (Han and Barton, 2002; Washenberger et al., 2007) . Moreover, nucleoside modifications in host mRNAs, rarely observed in viral RNAs, have also been shown to confer protection from RNaseL (Anderson et al., 2011) . In addition to directly targeting viral RNA, the reduction in functional ribosomes and ribosomal protein mRNA affects viral protein synthesis and replication in an indirect manner. Probably, as a reflection of these effects on cellular RNAs, RNaseL is implicated as one of the factors determining the anti-proliferative effect of IFN activity . The anti-viral activity of RNaseL extends beyond direct cleavage of viral RNA, through stimulation of RIG-I by the cleavage product (Malathi et al., , 2007 (Malathi et al., , 2010 . A global effect of RNaseL is observed in the form of autophagy induced through c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling and apoptosis, probably as a consequence of rRNA cleavage (Li et al., 2004; Chakrabarti et al., 2012; Siddiqui and Malathi, 2012) . RNaseL has also been demonstrated to play a role in apoptotic cell death initiated by pharmacological agents extending the physiological role of this pathway beyond the boundary of being only an anti-viral mechanism (Castelli et al., 1997 (Castelli et al., , 1998 .\\n\\nThe ER serves as a conduit for maturation of cellular proteins which are either secreted or destined to be associated with a membrane for its function. An exclusive microenvironment (high Calcium ion and unique ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione) along with a battery of ER-lumen resident enzymes (foldases, chaperones, and lectins) catalyse/mediate the necessary folding, disulfide-bond formation, and glycosylation reactions (Schroder and Kaufman, 2005) . A perturbation of the folding capacity, due to either physiological disturbances or virus infection, can lead to an accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER lumen, which signals an unfolded protein response (UPR). UPR encompasses a networked transcriptional and translational gene-expression program, initiated by three ER-membrane resident sensors namely IRE1 or ERN1, PKR-like ER Kinase (PERK or EIF2AK3) and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6; Hetz, 2012) . IRE1 is a type I single-pass trans-membrane protein in which, similar to what is observed with RNaseL, the N-terminal resident in the ER lumen serves as sensor and the cytosolic C-terminal as the effector (Figure 1 ; Chen and Brandizzi, 2013) . The IRE1 coding gene is present in genomes ranging from yeast to mammals and in the latter is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues (Tirasophon et al., 1998) . Signal transduction by stimulated IRE1 initiates multiple gene regulatory pathways with either pro-survival or pro-apoptotic consequences (Kaufman, 1999) . During homeostasis or unstressed conditions the sensor molecules are monomeric, a state maintained co-operatively by the \" absence\" of unfolded proteins and the \"presence\" of HSPA5 (GRP78 or Bip, an ERresident chaperone) molecules bound to a membrane-proximal disordered segment of the protein in the ER-lumen-resident Nterminus (Credle et al., 2005) . Accumulated unfolded proteins in the lumen triggers coupling of this domain from adjacent sensor molecules through a combination of (a) titration of the bound HSPA5 chaperone molecules and (b) direct tethering by malfolded protein molecules (Shamu and Walter, 1996; Credle et al., 2005; Aragon et al., 2009; Korennykh et al., 2009) . Abutting of the luminal domains juxtapose the cytosolic C-terminal segments, leading to an aggregation of the IRE1 molecules into distinct ER-membrane foci (Kimata et al., 2007; Li et al., 2010) . The C-terminal segment has a serine/threonine kinase domain and a RNase domain homologous to that of RNaseL (Figure 1 ; Tirasophon et al., 1998 Tirasophon et al., , 2000 . A trans-autophosphorylation by the kinase domain allosterically activates the RNase domain (Tirasophon et al., 2000; Lee et al., 2008; Korennykh et al., 2009) . In fact, exogenous over-expression of IRE1 in mammalian cells lead to activation suggesting that, under homeostatic conditions, the non-juxtaposition of cytosolic domains maintains an inactive IRE1 (Tirasophon et al., 1998) . Once activated, IRE1 performs cleavage of a variety of RNA substrates mediated by its RNase domain, in addition to phosphorylating and thereby activating JNK (Cox and Walter, 1996; Urano et al., 2000) . Depending on the RNA substrate, the cleavage catalyzed by IRE1 RNase produces differential consequence. Although scission of the Xbp1 mRNA transcript at two internal positions is followed by splicing of the internal segment through ligation of the terminal cleavage products, that in all other known IRE1 target RNA is followed by degradation (Figure 1 ; Sidrauski and Walter, 1997; Calfon et al., 2002) . The latter mode of negative regulation of gene expression is termed as the regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD) pathway (Hollien and Weissman, 2006; Oikawa et al., 2007; Iqbal et al., 2008; Lipson et al., 2008) . Gene transcripts regulated by RIDD pathway includes that from IRE1 (i.e., selftranscripts), probably in a negative feedback loop mechanism (Tirasophon et al., 2000) . In addition to protein coding RNA, RIDD pathway down-regulates the level of a host of microRNA precursors (pre-miRNAs) and can potentially cleave in the anticodon loop of tRNA Phe (Korennykh et al., 2011; Upton et al., 2012) .\\n\\nThe IRE1 RNase domain cleaves the Xbp1u (u for unspliced) mRNA transcript at two precise internal positions within the open reading frame (ORF) generating three segments, the terminal two of which are ligated by a tRNA ligase in yeast and by an unknown ligase in mammalian cells, to produce the Xbp1s (s for spliced) mRNA transcript (Figure 1 ; Yoshida et al., 2001) . The Xbp1s thus generated has a longer ORF, which is created by a frame-shift in the coding sequence downstream of the splice site (Cox and Walter, 1996; Calfon et al., 2002) . A similar dual endonucleolytic cleavage is also observed to initiate the XRN1 and Ski2-3-8 dependent degradation of transcripts in the RIDD degradation pathway (Hollien and Weissman, 2006) . The RIDD target transcript genes are predominantly those that encode membrane-associated or secretory proteins and which are not necessary for ER proteinfolding reactions (Hollien and Weissman, 2006) . The cleavage of Xbp1 and the RIDD-target transcripts constitute homeostatic or pro-survival response by IRE1 since XBP1S trans-activates genes encoding multiple chaperones (to fold unfolded proteins) and the ERAD pathway genes (to degrade terminally misfolded proteins) whereas RIDD reduces flux of polypeptides entering the ER lumen (Lee et al., 2003; Hollien and Weissman, 2006) . On the other hand, cleavage of pre-miRNA transcripts which are processed in the cell to generate CASPASE-2 mRNA (Casp2) controlling miRNAs, constitutes the pro-apoptotic function of IRE1 (Upton et al., 2012) . Another pro-apoptotic signal from IRE1 emanates from signaling through phosphorylation of JNK1 (Urano et al., 2000) . Although in the initial phase RIDD activity does not cleave mRNAs encoding essential ER proteins, at later stages of chronic UPR such transcripts are rendered susceptible to degradation promoting apoptosis induction (Han et al., 2009; Bhattacharyya et al., 2014) .\\n\\nInfection of mammalian cells by a multitude of viruses induce an UPR which is sometimes characterized by suppression of signaling by one or more of the three sensor(s; Su et al., 2002; Tardif et al., 2002; He, 2006; Yu et al., 2006 Yu et al., , 2013 Medigeshi et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2010; Merquiol et al., 2011) . Among these at least two viruses from diverse families, HCMV (a DNA virus) and hepatitis C virus (a hepacivirus), interfere with IRE1 signaling by different mechanism (Tardif et al., 2004; Stahl et al., 2013 ). An observed inhibition of any cellular function by a virus infection could suggest a potential anti-virus function for it, which the virus has evolved to evade through blocking some critical step(s). In both the cases mentioned above, stability of the viral proteins seems to be affected by ERAD-mediated degradation, although other potential anti-viral effect of IRE1 activation are not clear yet (Isler et al., 2005; Saeed et al., 2011) . Interestingly, host mRNA fragments produced following IRE1 activation during bacterial infection, has been shown to activate RIG-I signaling (Figure 1 ; Cho et al., 2013b) . Theoretically, other functions of IRE1 can also have anti-viral effect necessitating its inhibition for uninhibited viral replication. It is, however, still not clear whether IRE1 is able to cleave any viral RNA (or mRNA) in a manner similar to that of other RIDD targets (Figure 1) . The possibilities of such a direct anti-viral function are encouraged by the fact that all these viruses encode at least one protein which, as part of its maturation process, requires glycosylation and disulfide-bond formation. Such a necessity would entail translation of the mRNA encoding such a protein, which in case of positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses would mean the genome, in association with the ER-membrane (Figure 1 ; Lerner et al., 2003) . Additionally for many RNA viruses, replication complexes are housed in ER-derived vesicular structures (Denison, 2008; den Boon et al., 2010) . Considering the proximity of IRE1 and these virus-derived RNAs it is tempting to speculate that probably at some point of time in the viral life cycle one or more virus-associated RNA would be susceptible to cleavage by IRE1. However, studies with at least two viruses have shown that instead of increasing viral titre, inhibiting the RNase activity of activated IRE1 has an opposite effect (Hassan et al., 2012; Bhattacharyya et al., 2014) . This implies potential benefits of IRE1 activation through one or more of the following, (a) expression of chaperones or other pro-viral molecules downstream of XBP1Supregulation or JNK-activation, (b) cleavage of potential anti-viral gene mRNA transcripts by RIDD activity. However, the mode of protection for the viral RNA from RIDD activity is still not clear. It is possible that the viral proteins create a subdomain within the ER membrane, which through some mechanism excludes IRE1 from diffusing near the genomic RNA, thereby protecting the replication complexes (Denison, 2008) . It is therefore probably not surprising that single-stranded plus-sense RNA viruses encode a polyprotein, which produces replication complexes in cis, promoting formation of such subdomains (Egger et al., 2000) . The fact that IRE1 forms bulky oligomers of higher order probably aggravates such an exclusion of the activated sensor molecules from vicinity of the viral replication complexes. The UPR signaling eventually attenuate during chronic ER-stress and since that is what a virus-induced UPR mimics, probably the viral RNA needs protection only during the initial phase of UPR activation (Lin et al., 2007) . Since the choice of RIDD target seems to be grossly driven towards mRNAs that encode ER-transitory but are not ER-essential proteins, it is also possible that one or more viral protein have evolved to mimic a host protein the transcript of which is RIDD-resistant (Hollien and Weissman, 2006) . Most of the RIDD target mRNA are observed to be ER-membrane associated, the proximity to IRE1 facilitating association and cleavage (Figure 1 ; Hollien and Weissman, 2006) . Although ER-association for an mRNA is possible without the mediation of ribosomes, Gaddam and co-workers reported that continued association with polysomes for a membrane-bound mRNA can confer protection from IRE1 cleavage (Cui et al., 2012; Gaddam et al., 2013) . This would suggest important implications for the observed refractory nature of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and influenza virus RNA to RIDD cleavage (Hassan et al., 2012; Bhattacharyya et al., 2014) . In contrast to Influenza virus, flaviviruses (which include JEV) do not suppress host protein synthesis implying the absence of a global inhibition on translation as would be expected during UPR (Clyde et al., 2006; Edgil et al., 2006) . Therefore, a continued translation of viral RNA in spite of UPR activation can in principle confer protection from the pattern of RNA cleavage observed in the RIDD pathway.\\n\\nIRE1 and RNaseL, in addition to biochemical similarities in protein kinase domain and structural similarities in their RNase domain, share the functional consequences of their activation in initiating cellular apoptosis through JNK signaling (Table 1 and Figure 2 ; Liu and Lin, 2005; Dhanasekaran and Reddy, 2008) . Though initial discoveries were made in the context of homeostatic and anti-viral role for the former and latter, differences between the pathways are narrowed by further advances in research. In the same vein, while inhibition of IRE1 signaling in virus infected cells indicates a potential anti-viral role, www.frontiersin.org (Tirasophon et al., 1998; Dong and Silverman, 1999; Papa et al., 2003; Lin et al., 2007) Nature of RNase substrates Both 28S rRNA and mRNAs IRE1β can cleave both 28S rRNA and mRNA while IRE1α substrates include only mRNAs (Iwawaki et al., 2001) Dissimilarities\\n\\nCleavage substrates Beside 28S rRNA, predominantly cleaves mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins (Andersen et al., 2009) Xbp1u and other mRNAs in addition to microRNA precursors which are targeted as part of the RIDD pathway Selection of cleavage site Cleaved between 2nd and 3rd nucleotide positions of UN/N sites (Han et al., 2014) RNA sequence with the consensus of 5 -CUGCAG-3 in association with a stem-loop (SL) structure essential for recognition of Xbp1u and other mRNAs (Oikawa et al., 2010) association of RNaseL mutations with generation of prostate cancer extends the ambit of influence of this anti-viral effector to more non-infectious physiological disorders (Silverman, 2003) . Biochemically, the similarity in their RNase domains does not extend to the choice of either substrates or cleavage point, which are downstream of UU or UA in RNaseL and downstream of G (predominantly) for IRE1 ( Figure 2C ; Yoshida et al., 2001; Hollien and Weissman, 2006; Upton et al., 2012) . Further, while RNaseL cleaves pre-dominantly in single-stranded region, IRE1 seems to cleave equally well in single-and double-stranded region (Upton et al., 2012) . However, a recent report suggested a consensus cleavage site with the sequence UN/N, in RNaseL targets and in those mRNAs that are cleaved by IRE1 as part of the RIDD pathway (Han et al., 2014) . Access to potential cleavage substrate for RNaseL is conjectured to be facilitated through its association with polyribosomes, while no such association is known for IRE1 (Salehzada et al., 1991) . Possibilities exist that IRE1 would have preferential distribution in the rough ER which, upon activation, would give it ready access to mRNAs for initiating the RIDD pathway.\\n\\nIn the context of a virus infection, the pathway leading from both these proteins have the potential to lead to cell death. Notwithstanding the fact that this might be an efficient way of virus clearance, it also portends pathological outcomes for the infected organism. Future research would probably lead to design of drugs targeting these proteins based on the structural homology of their effector domains, regulating the pathological denouement of their activation without compromising their anti-viral or potential anti-viral functions.'}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '607aac27eebecf37ab6b3b23ea24ae7'}>,\n",

In the last few decades, Schiff bases and their complexes have become well known for their extensive biological potential. In the present study, we examined the antiproliferative effect of a copper (II) complex on HT-29 colon cancer cells. The Cu(BrHAP)(2 ) Schiff base compound demonstrated a potent antiproliferative effect in HT-29 cells, with an IC(50 )value of 2.87 μg/ml after 72 h of treatment. HT-29 cells treated with Cu (II) complexes underwent apoptosis death, as exhibited by a progressive elevation in the proportion of the G(1 ) cell population. At a concentration of 6.25 μg/ml, the Cu(BrHAP)(2 ) compound caused significant elevation in ROS production following perturbation of mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome c release, as assessed by the measurement of fluorescence intensity in stained cells. Furthermore, the activation of caspases 3/7 and 9 was part of the Cu (II) complex-induced apoptosis, which confirmed the involvement of mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis. Meanwhile, there was no significant activation of caspase-8. Taken together, these results imply that the Cu(BrHAP)(2 ) compound is a potential candidate for further in vivo and clinical colon cancer studies to develop novel chemotherapeutic agents derived from metal-based agents.\\n\\nText: Cancer is a debilitating disease that afflicts a substantial portion of the world population in all generations and is a major health problem of global concern [1] . Among the various types of cancer, colorectal cancer is the second and third most prevalent cancer among males and females in the United States, respectively. In spite of all the considerable progress in protective methods and recent improvements in screening techniques and chemotherapy, the 1-year and 5-year relative survival rates for patients suffering from colorectal cancer are 83.2% and 64.3%, respectively [2] . In addition, due to bitter controversy over optimal methods for early detection, full compliance of patients with screening recommendations remains a major hindrance for diagnosis at the early stages of cancer development. Development of resistance to chemotherapy also represents a critical issue for which simultaneous treatment with various classes of therapeutics to reduce the resistance has yielded some success [3] . Moreover, the numerous side effects of chemotherapeutic drugs on cancer patients, including hair loss, diarrhea, bleeding, and immunosuppression, have made the process 2\\n\\nThe Scientific World Journal of treatment more complicated [4] . The highly regulated programmed cell death process of apoptosis is a matter of great interest in oncology and cancer therapy and represents a common molecular pathway for drug resistance and carcinogenesis [5] .\\n\\nMaintenance of a constant cell number in the colonic mucosa is highly regulated through the balance between apoptosis and cell proliferation. The perturbation in this balance leads to an escape from normal cell number homeostasis and is associated with the progression of cancer cells [6, 7] . Thus, suppression of proliferation and elevation of apoptosis in these aberrant cells are suggested to be the essential mechanism for the inhibition of colon cancer. Furthermore, apoptosis and the factors involved in its mechanism of action also present a window that can be exploited for the improvement of potential therapeutic agents with high effectiveness and less adverse side effects [8] . Hence, screening for novel compounds capable of inducing apoptosis in colon cancer cells that can be used alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs is a significant need and represents a critical challenge in medicinal chemistry.\\n\\nMetal complexes have been extensively utilized in clinics for centuries and have attracted numerous inorganic chemists to analyze them, with the main focus being medical applications [9, 10] . Copper, an essential trace element with an oxidative nature and bioessential activity in human metabolism, does not exist in an ionic form in biological systems. Thus, measurement of copper in the body is evaluated in the form of complexes with organic compounds [11] . Schiff bases are a critical class of compounds in medical chemistry that have demonstrated significant chemotherapeutic and antibacterial application [12, 13] . Schiff base Cu(II) complexes revealed great potential for antiproliferative, antibacterial, and gastroprotective activity [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . This study evaluated the anticancer potential of a copper (II) complex derived from N,N -dimethyl ethylene diamine and 2-hydroxyacetophenone Schiff base ligand, Cu(BrHAP) 2 . Furthermore, the possible apoptotic mechanism underlying this activity was also examined. Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Life Technologies, Inc., Rockville, MD) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 g/mL streptomycin, and 100 U/mL penicillin G at 37 ∘ C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2 /95% air. The cells were plated at a fitting density in tissue culture flasks (Corning, USA) according to each experimental scale. Cell viability was measured by a conventional MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] reduction assay. After 48 h exposure to six concentrations of Cu(BrHAP) 2 , cells were treated with MTT solution (2 mg/mL) for 2 h. The dark formazan crystals formed in intact cells were dissolved in DMSO, and the absorbance was measured at 570 nm and 650 nm as a background using a microplate reader (Hidex, Turku, Finland). The IC 50 value was determined as the concentration of Cu(BrHAP) 2 required to reduce the absorbance of treated cells to 50% of the DMSO-treated control cells. All samples were prepared in triplicates.\\n\\nAssay. Measurement of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release is a biomarker for determining the cytotoxicity of a compound. Briefly, HT-29 cells were treated with different concentrations of Cu(BrHAP) 2 and Triton X-100 (positive control) for 48 h, and the supernatants of the untreated and treated cells were transferred to a new 96-well plate for LDH activity analysis. Next, 100 L of LDH reaction solution was added to each well, the plate was incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and the absorbance was read at 490 nm using a Tecan Infinite 200 Pro (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland) microplate reader. The amount of formazan salt and intensity of red color in treated and untreated samples were represented as the LDH activity of cells. The LDH release level in cells treated with Cu(BrHAP) 2 was expressed as a percentage of the positive control.\\n\\nA propidium iodide (PI) and acridine orange (AO) double staining assay were carried out for detection of apoptosis in the treated cells using a fluorescent microscope (Leica attached with Q-Floro software) according to a standard procedure. HT-29 cells (5 × 10 4 cells/mL in a 25 mL culture flask) were plated, treated with Cu(BrHAP) 2 at the IC 50 concentration, and incubated for 24, 48, and 72 h. After harvesting the cells, they were stained with fluorescent dyes and observed under a UV-fluorescent microscope (Olympus BX51) within 30 min.\\n\\nIn brief, HT-29 cells (1 × 10 4 cells/well in 96-well plate) were supplemented with Cu(BrHAP) 2 (2 g/mL) or DMSO (negative control) for 24 h. The live cells were then incubated with BrdU and Phospho-Histone H3 dyes for 30 min. After the cells were fixed and stained as described by the manufacturer's instructions, they were visualized and analyzed using the Cellomics ArrayScan HCS reader (Thermo Scientific). The fluorescence intensities of the dyes were measured using a target activation bioapplication module.\\n\\nTo confirm the result of the fluorescence cell cycle analysis, HT-29 cells (5 × 10 4 cells/mL) were treated with Cu(BrHAP) 2 for 24, 48, and 72 h for flow cytometry analysis. After incubation, HT-29 cells were spun down at 1800 rpm for 5 min. Next, fixation of a cell population for flow cytometry analysis was carried out to restore integrity. In brief, the cell pellets were fixed by mixing them with 700 L of cold ethanol (90%) and were then kept at 4 ∘ C overnight. Treated HT-29 cells were spun down, and the ethanol was discarded. After washing and suspending the cells in PBS, 25 L of RNase A (10 mg/mL) and 50 L of propidium iodide (PI) (1 mg/mL) were added to the fixed cells for 1 h at 37 ∘ C. The added RNase A limited the ability of PI to bind to only DNA molecules. At the end, the DNA content of the cells was analyzed by a flow cytometer (BD FACSCanto II).\\n\\nThe oxygen radical antioxidant capacity (ORAC) assay was carried out based on the protocols described in detail previously [19] . In brief, Cu(BrHAP) 2 at the concentration of 100 g/mL was used for this assay in a total reaction volume of 200 L. The experiment was performed in a black 96-well microplate with 25 L of compound, blank (solvent/PBS), standard (trolox), or positive control (quercetin). The plate was then supplemented with the working fluorescein solution (150 L), followed by a 5 min incubation at 37 ∘ . The total volume of 200 L was made up by adding 25 L of AAPH working solution. Fluorescence intensity was measured at an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 538 nm every 2 min for 2 h. The result was quantified by calculating the differences of area under the fluorescence decay curve (AUC) of samples and blank. The values were Trolox equivalents (TE).\\n\\nIn brief, HT-29 cells (1 × 10 4 cells/mL) were seeded in 96-well plates and treated with different concentrations of Cu(BrHAP) 2 and DMSO (negative control) for 24 h. After 30 min treatment with dihydroethidium (DHE) dye, cells were fixed and washed with wash buffer as described by the manufacturer's instructions. In the presence of superoxides, DHE dye is oxidized to ethidium. The fluorescence intensity was determined by a fluorescent plate reader at an extension wavelength of 520 nm and an emission wavelength of 620 nm.\\n\\nThe critical factors for monitoring the cell health, namely, cell loss, changes in cell permeability, cytochrome release, mitochondrial membrane potential changes, nuclear size, and morphological changes, were studied using a Cellomics Multiparameter Cytotoxicity 3 Kit as described in detail previously [20] . Plates with stained cells were analyzed using the ArrayScan HCS system (Cellomics, PA, USA).\\n\\nCaspases 3/7, -8, and 9 activities were determined using the commercial caspase-Glo 3/7, 8, and 9 assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI). HT-29 cells (1.0 × 10 4 cells/well) were seeded overnight in white-walled 96-well plates and treated with different concentrations of Cu(BrHAP) 2 for 24 h. According to the manufacturer's protocol, the treated cells were supplemented with caspase-Glo reagent (100 L) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The active caspases from apoptotic cells caused the cleavage of aminoluciferin-labeled synthetic tetrapeptide, leading to the release of substrate for the luciferase enzyme. Caspase activities were analyzed using a Tecan Infinite 200 Pro (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland) microplate reader.\\n\\nIn brief, HT-29 cells (1.0 × 10 4 cells/well in a 96-well plate) were treated with different concentrations of Cu(BrHAP) 2 for 3 h, followed by stimulation with TNF-(1 ng/mL) for 30 min. After discarding the medium, cells were fixed and stained using a Cellomics nucleus factor-B (NF-B) activation kit (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Next, an Array Scan HCS Reader was used for evaluation of the plate. Cytoplasmic and nuclear NF-B intensity ratios were calculated using Cytoplasm to Nucleus Translocation Bioapplication software. The average intensity of 200 cells/well was determined. The ratios for untreated, treated, and TNF-stimulated cells were compared.\\n\\nAll the experiments were performed at least three times independently. The results were presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD) of the number of experiments shown in the legends. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was carried out using the prism statistical package (GraphPad Software, USA). < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\\n\\nCells of the Colon. Initially, the cytotoxicity of Cu(BrHAP) 2 was tested on HT-29 and CCD 841 cell lines. The IC 50 values of the Schiff base compound were determined based on the result collected from three independent MTT experiments. As indicated in Table 1 , Cu(BrHAP) 2 elicited a significant cytotoxicity and cell inhibitory effect after 24, 48, and 72 h of treatment on HT-29 cell. 2 -Induced LDH Release. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release in the medium is a marker that shows the loss of membrane integrity, apoptosis, or necrosis. The cytotoxicity of the Cu(BrHAP) 2 compound, as determined by the LDH release assay, was quantified on HT-29 cells treated with various concentrations of the Schiff base compound for 48 h. Cu(BrHAP) 2 induced a significant elevation in LDH release, demonstrating cytotoxicity at the 6.25 and 12.5 g/mL concentrations compared to the control cells ( Figure 2 ).\\n\\nMicroscopy and AO/PI Double Staining. Morphological changes in HT-29 cells treated with Cu(BrHAP) 2 compound were observed under a fluorescent microscope at 24, 48, and 72 h. The cells were scored under a fluorescent microscope to analyze viable cells, early apoptosis, and late apoptosis. Early apoptosis, defined as intervening AO within the fragmented DNA, was observed under bright green fluorescence. At the same time, control cells were visualized with a green intact nuclear structure. After 24 and 48 h of treatment with Cu(BrHAP) 2 , moderate apoptosis was observed in the form of blebbing and nuclear chromatin condensation. Furthermore, in the late stage of apoptosis, changes, such as the presence of a reddish-orange color due to binding of PI to denatured DNA, were observed after 72 h of treatment ( Figure 3) . The results showed that the Cu(BrHAP) 2 compound induced morphological features of apoptosis in a time-dependent manner. Figure 4 , demonstrated that there is no cell cycle arrest in the S/M phases. The lack of cell cycle arrest in the S/M phases suggested possible cell cycle arrest in the G 1 /G 2 phases. To determine the exact arrested phase, treated HT-29 cells were analyzed for cell cycle progression using flow cytometry. As expected, there was no significant arrest in the S/M phases. Meanwhile, significant cell cycle arrest in the G 1 phase was observed for HT-29 cells after 24 and 48 h of treatment ( Figure 5 ).\\n\\nAssay. Antioxidant capacity was measured by ORAC assay, which is the only assay that involves the use of peroxyl radical as a prooxidant and quantifies activity via the area under the curve (AUC) technique. In our experiment, quercetin was used as a positive control. The result demonstrated that Cu(BrHAP) 2 exhibited low to moderate antioxidant activity compared to quercetin ( Table 2) .\\n\\nFormation. HT-29 cells were treated with different concentrations of Cu(BrHAP) 2 for 24 h and stained with DHE dye to determine the influence of the Schiff base compound on ROS production. The fluorescence intensities of DHE oxidization by ROS were quantified using a fluorescence microplate reader. As depicted in Figure 6 , exposure to the Schiff base compound caused a significant elevation in the ROS levels of treated HT-29 cells at the 6.25 g/mL concentration.\\n\\nTo investigate the induction of apoptosis by Cu(BrHAP) 2 , nuclear morphological changes in HT-29 cells were analyzed by detection of nuclear condensation. As shown in Figure 7 , Hoechst 33342 staining demonstrated that nuclear condensation, which is directly related to apoptotic chromatin changes, emerged in some cells after treatment with Cu(BrHAP) 2 . Meanwhile, the permeability of treated cells was also elevated. Mitochondria are the main source for the production of ROS and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and are critical in controlling the death and survival of cells. The reduction in fluorescence intensity depicted in Figure 6 Cu(BrHAP) 2 triggered the translocation of cytochrome from mitochondria into the cytosol during apoptosis in HT-29 cells.\\n\\nActivation. The elevation in ROS production associated with a collapse in MMP may lead to the activation of the caspase cascade. To investigate caspase activation, the bioluminescent intensities representing caspases 3/7, 8, and 9 activities were quantified in HT-29 cells treated with different concentrations of Cu(BrHAP) 2 for 24 h. As shown in Figure 8 , significant elevation in the activity of caspase-3/7 at the 6.25 g/mL concentration and caspase-9 at the 6.25 and 12.5 g/mL concentrations was observed in Cu(BrHAP) 2treated cells, while no significant change in the activity of caspase-8 was detected between treated and untreated HT-29 cells. Thus, the apoptosis induced by the Schiff base compound in HT-29 cells is possibly mediated via the intrinsic pathway, but not the extrinsic pathway.\\n\\nis a transcription factor that has a critical role in cytokine gene expression. NF-B activation and translocation to the nucleus to enable DNA-binding activity and facilitate target gene expression are mediated by inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-(TNF-). The Cu(BrHAP) 2 Schiff base compound did not exhibit any inhibitory effect on translocation of TNF--stimulated NF-B in HT-29 treated cells, and TNF--stimulation led to NF-B translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (Figure 9 ).\\n\\nCarcinogenesis is a multistage process in which unregulated cell proliferation as well as a reduction in apoptosis incidence serves as initial characterizations for its progression [21] . One of the defense procedures in multicellular organisms is the destruction of undesirable cell development, which is defined as programmed cell death. Apoptosis is the most noticed programmed cell death mechanism and is characterized by distinct morphological changes such as membrane permeability, cell shrinkage, disruption of the mitochondrial membrane, and chromatin condensation [22, 23]. The disruption of cellular homeostasis between cell death and cell proliferation leads to cancer incidence [24] , and agents that can induce apoptosis are known to have potential anticancer effects [25, 26] . Apoptosis pathways are effective targets for cancer therapy as well as chemoprevention. Numerous chemopreventive drugs have been determined to regulate key events or molecules in apoptosis-inducing signal transduction pathways [27] . In the present study, the Cu(BrHAP) 2 Schiff base compound was evaluated for its ability to inhibit the growth of HT-29 cells using an MTT assay. HT-29 cells have recently been characterized as a suitable model for colon cancer studies [28] [29] [30] . human colon cancer cells in a time-and dose-dependent manner. Meanwhile, the nontumorigenic colon cell line (CCD 841) showed no cytotoxicity after treatment with the compound. The cytotoxic effect of the Cu(II) compound was also confirmed by measuring the level of LDH release from treated cells. Considerably elevated LDH release showed that the cytotoxicity of the Cu(BrHAP) 2 compound possibly occurred via the loss of membrane integrity, whether through activation of apoptosis or the necrosis pathway [31] . The observation of early apoptosis and late apoptosis by fluorescent microscopy analysis and AO/PI double staining following treatment of HT-29 cells with the compound included some signs of apoptosis, namely, cytoplasmic shrinkage, membrane blebbing, and DNA fragmentation [32, 33] . We found that the number of cells with early apoptosis features was higher at earlier stages of treatment. However, when treatment time increased to 72 h, late apoptosis or necrosis characterizations were dominant among treated HT-29 cells. Concurrent detection of late apoptosis or necrosis is scientifically possible because treated HT-29 cells undergoing apoptosis may have progressed into necrosis due to the prolonged incubation with the Schiff base compound.\\n\\nTo elucidate the mechanisms underlying the observed antiproliferative effect of the Cu(II) complex on cancer cells, cell cycle distribution was analyzed using BrdU and Phospho-Histone H3 staining along with flow cytometry [34] [35] [36] . BrdU dye can attach to the synthesized DNA of replicating cells during the S phase of the cell cycle, while Phospho-Histone H3 dye stains cells in different mitotic stages. The cell cycle results from the BrdU and Phospho-Histone H3 double staining assay indicated that there were no significant changes in the number of cells in the S/M phases after the exposure of HT-29 cells to the Schiff base compound. This result suggests the possibility that the cells were arrested in the G 1 or G 2 phase of the cell cycle. Thus, the flow cytometry analysis of the cell cycle was performed to determine the exact arrested phase, and the results demonstrated significant cell cycle arrest at G 1 after 24 and 48 h of treatment, suggesting proliferative suppression via induction of apoptosis [37, 38] .\\n\\nPerturbation of mitochondrial membrane potential is one of the earliest intracellular events that occur following the induction of apoptosis [39] . As the main source of cellular ROS and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), mitochondria are the key regulators of mechanisms controlling the survival or death of cells. After confirming that the Cu(BrHAP) 2 Schiff base compound did not have significant antioxidant capacity in HT-29 cancer cells using the ORAC assay, the induction of ROS production in treated cells was analyzed. According to our study, after exposing the Cu(II) compound to HT-29 cells and analyzing the levels of ROS, it was demonstrated that the level of ROS in treated HT-29 cells was significantly elevated at a compound concentration of 6.25 g/mL.\\n\\nIn metal-induced apoptosis, the mitochondria have the crucial role in mediating apoptosis through metal-induced ROS [40] . The intrinsic or mitochondrial-dependent signaling pathway involves different factors of nonreceptor-mediated stimuli that induce intracellular signals. These signals, mainly through the p53 protein, act on the mitochondrialinitiated events. Excessive ROS production is a negative signal that can result in the failure of suppression of antiapoptotic factors, thereby triggering apoptosis. Therefore, we used mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) fluorescent probes to examine the effect of elevated ROS production on the function of mitochondria in treated HT-29 cells. As shown in Figure 7 , changes in MMP after treatment with the Cu(BrHAP) 2 Schiff base compound leading to the membrane depolarization of the mitochondria were demonstrated by Rhodamine 123 release to the cytoplasm from the mitochondria matrix. The result implies that the induction of apoptosis by Cu(II) Schiff base complexes may be associated with the mitochondrial pathway [26, 41, 42] . One of the important signals to initiate the procedure of apoptosis is cytosolic cytochrome . The release of cytochrome into the cytosol and reduction of its levels in the mitochondria have been shown to occur as a result of changes in MMP [30] . As the result illustrated, the synthetic Schiff base compound also led to an increase in the level of cytochrome in the cytosol compared to the control.\\n\\nThe excessive production of ROS from mitochondria and the collapse of MMP may activate the downstream caspase molecules and consequently lead to apoptotic cell death. After the binding of cytochrome to apoptotic activating factor-1, caspase-9 is activated via apoptosome formation, which leads to active caspase-3/7, the most effective caspase with many cellular targets [43] . In the extrinsic pathway, apoptosis is mediated by death receptors. As an example, FAS ligand interacts with the FAS receptor, leading to the activation of caspase-8 [44] . Caspase-8 activation cleaves and activates downstream executioner caspases such as caspase-3/7 [45, 46] . In our study, the Cu(BrHAP) 2 schiff base compound induced significant elevation in the caspases 3/7 and 9 activities compared to the control. Meanwhile, there was no activation of caspase-8, suggesting that the apoptosis induced in HT-29 cells was mediated via the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway but not the extrinsic, death receptor-linked caspase-8 pathway.\\n\\nThe supporting evidence of LDH release, ROS production, MMP suppression, elevation in the level of cytochrome , and activation of caspases 3/7 and 9 demonstrated the promising anticancer activity of the Cu(BrHAP) 2 Schiff base compound against the HT-29 colon cancer cell line via the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway.\"}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '786f8a761614c6c66a39b5e1a65c458a'}>,\n",

Over the last 20 years, there has been a substantial decrease in the incidence of childhood pneumonia and pneumonia-associated mortality. New conjugate vaccines against Haemophilus influenzae type b and Streptococcus pneumoniae have contributed to decreases in radiologic, clinical and complicated pneumonia cases and have reduced hospitalization and mortality. The importance of co-infections with multiple pathogens and the predominance of viral-associated disease are emerging. Better access to effective preventative and management strategies is needed in low- and middle-income countries, while new strategies are needed to address the residual burden of disease once these have been implemented.\\n\\nText: Pneumonia has been the leading cause of death in children younger than 5 years for decades. Although there have been substantial decreases in overall child mortality and in pneumonia-specific mortality, pneumonia remains the major single cause of death in children outside the neonatal period, causing approximately 900,000 of the estimated 6.3 million child deaths in 2013 [1] . Substantial advances have occurred in the understanding of risk factors and etiology of pneumonia, in development of standardized case definitions, and in prevention with the production of improved vaccines and in treatment. Such advances have led to changes in the epidemiology, etiology and mortality from childhood pneumonia. However in many areas access to these interventions remains sub-optimal, with large inequities between and within countries and regions. In this paper we review the impact of recent preventative and management advances in pneumonia epidemiology, etiology, radiologic presentation and outcome in children.\\n\\nThe overall burden of childhood pneumonia has been reduced substantially over the last decade, despite an increase in the global childhood population from 605 million in 2000 to 664 million in 2015 [2] . Recent data suggest that there has been a 25% decrease in the incidence of pneumonia, from 0.29 episodes per child year in low-and middle-income countries in 2000, to 0.22 episodes per child year in 2010 [3] . This is substantiated by a 58% decrease in pneumonia-associated disability-adjusted life years between 1990 and 2013, from 186 million to 78 million as estimated in the Global Burden of Disease study [1] . Pneumonia deaths decreased from 1.8 million in 2000 to 900,000 in 2013 [1] . These data do not reflect the full impact of increasingly widespread use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in low-and middle-income countries because the incidence of pneumonia and number of deaths are likely to decrease still further as a result of this widespread intervention [4] .\\n\\nNotwithstanding this progress, there remains a disproportionate burden of disease in low-and middle-income countries, where more than 90% of pneumonia cases and deaths occur. The incidence in high-income countries is estimated at 0.015 episodes per child year, compared to 0.22 episodes per child year in low-and middle-income countries [3] . On average, 1 in 66 children in high-income countries is affected by pneumonia per year, compared to 1 in 5 children in low-and middle-income countries. Even within low-and middleincome countries there are regional inequities and challenges with access to health care services: up to 81% of severe pneumonia deaths occur outside a hospital [5] . In addition to a higher incidence of pneumonia, the case fatality rate is estimated to be almost 10-fold higher in low-and middle-income countries as compared to high-income countries [3, 5] .\\n\\nChildhood pneumonia can also lead to significant morbidity and chronic disease. Early life pneumonia can impair longterm lung health by decreasing lung function [6] . Severe or recurrent pneumonia can have a worse effect on lung function; increasing evidence suggests that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease might be related to early childhood pneumonia [7, 8] . A meta-analysis of the risk of long-term outcomes after childhood pneumonia categorized chronic respiratory sequelae into major (restrictive lung disease, obstructive lung disease, bronchiectasis) and minor (chronic bronchitis, asthma, abnormal pulmonary function) groups [9] . The risk of developing at least one of the major sequelae was estimated as 6% after an ambulatory pneumonia event and 14% after an episode of hospitalized pneumonia. Because respiratory diseases affect almost 1 billion people globally and are a major cause of mortality and morbidity [10] , childhood pneumonia might contribute to substantial morbidity across the life course.\\n\\nChest radiologic changes have been considered the gold standard for defining a pneumonia event [11] because clinical findings can be subjective and clinical definitions of pneumonia can be nonspecific. In 2005, to aid in defining outcomes of pneumococcal vaccine studies, the World Health Organization\\'s (WHO) standardized chest radiograph description defined a group of children who were considered most likely to have pneumococcal pneumonia [12] . The term \"end-point consolidation\" was described as a dense or fluffy opacity that occupies a portion or whole of a lobe, or the entire lung. \"Other infiltrate\" included linear and patchy densities, peribronchial thickening, minor patchy infiltrates that are not of sufficient magnitude to constitute primary end-point consolidation, and small areas of atelectasis that in children can be difficult to distinguish from consolidation. \"Primary end-point pneumonia\" included either end-point consolidation or a pleural effusion associated with a pulmonary parenchymal infiltrate (including \"other\" infiltrate).\\n\\nWidespread use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination and Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccination has decreased the incidence of radiologic pneumonia. In a review of four randomized controlled trials and two case-control studies of Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccination in high-burden communities, the vaccination was associated with an 18% decrease in radiologic pneumonia [13] . Introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination was associated with a 26% decrease in radiologic pneumonia in California between 1995 and 1998 [14] . In vaccine efficacy trials in low-and middle-income countries, pneumococcal conjugate vaccination reduced radiologic pneumonia by 37% in the Gambia [15] , 25% in South Africa [16] and 26% in the Philippines [17] .\\n\\nThe WHO radiologic case definition was not intended to distinguish bacterial from viral etiology but rather to define a sub-set of pneumonia cases in which pneumococcal infection was considered more likely and to provide a set of standardized definitions through which researchers could achieve broad agreement in reporting chest radiographs. However, despite widespread field utilization, there are concerns regarding inter-observer repeatability. There has been good consensus for the description of lobar consolidation but significant disagreement on the description of patchy and perihilar infiltrates [18, 19] . In addition, many children with clinically severe lung disease do not have primary end-point pneumonia: in one pre-pneumococcal conjugate vaccination study, only 34% of children hospitalized with pneumonia had primary end-point pneumonia [20] . A revised case definition of \"presumed bacterial pneumonia\" has been introduced, and this definition includes pneumonia cases with WHO-defined alveolar consolidation, as well as those with other abnormal chest radiograph infiltrates and a serum C-reactive protein of at least 40 mg/L [21, 22] . This definition has been shown to have greater sensitivity than the original WHO radiologic definition of primary end-point pneumonia for detecting the burden of pneumonia prevented by pneumococcal conjugate vaccination [23] . Using the revised definition, the 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-10), had a vaccine efficacy of 22% in preventing presumed bacterial pneumonia in young children in South America [22] , and pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-13 had a vaccine efficacy of 39% in preventing presumed bacterial pneumonia in children older than 16 weeks who were not infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in South Africa [21] . Thus there is convincing evidence that pneumococcal conjugate vaccination decreases the incidence of radiologic pneumonia; however there is no evidence to suggest that pneumococcal conjugate vaccination modifies the radiologic appearance of pneumococcal pneumonia.\\n\\nEmpyema is a rare complication of pneumonia. An increased incidence of empyema in children was noted in some high-income countries following pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7 introduction, and this was attributed to pneumococcal serotypes not included in pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7, especially 3 and 19A [24] . In the United States, evidence from a national hospital database suggests that the incidence of empyema increased 1.9-fold between 1996 and 2008 [25] . In Australia, the incidence rate ratio increased by 1.4 times when comparing the pre-pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7 period (1998 to 2004) to the post-pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7 period (2005 to 2010) [26] . In Scotland, incidence of empyema in children rose from 6.5 per million between 1981 and 1998, to 66 per million in 2005 [27] . These trends have been reversed since the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-13. Data from the United States suggest that empyema decreased by 50% in children younger than 5 years [28] ; similarly, data from the United Kingdom and Scotland showed substantial reduction in pediatric empyema following pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-13 introduction [29, 30] .\\n\\nSeveral national guidelines from high-income countries, as well as the WHO recommendations for low-and middleincome countries, recommend that chest radiography should not be routinely performed in children with ambulatory pneumonia [31] [32] [33] . Indications for chest radiography include hospitalization, severe hypoxemia or respiratory distress, failed initial antibiotic therapy, or suspicion for other diseases (tuberculosis, inhaled foreign body) or complications. However, point-of-care lung ultrasound is emerging as a promising modality for diagnosing childhood pneumonia [34] .\\n\\nIn addition to the effect on radiologic pneumonia, pneumococcal conjugate vaccination reduces the risk of hospitalization from viral-associated pneumonia, probably by reducing bacterial-viral co-infections resulting in severe disease and hospitalization [35] . An analysis of ecological and observational studies of pneumonia incidence in different age groups soon after introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7 in Canada, Italy, Australia, Poland and the United States showed decreases in all-cause pneumonia hospitalizations ranging from 15% to 65% [36] . In the United States after pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-13 replaced pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7, there was a further 17% decrease in hospitalizations for pneumonia among children eligible for the vaccination, and a further 12% decrease among unvaccinated adults [28] .\\n\\nA systematic review of etiology studies prior to availability of new conjugate vaccines confirmed S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae type B as the most important bacterial causes of pneumonia, with Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae associated with some severe cases. Respiratory syncytial virus was the leading viral cause, identified in 15-40% of pneumonia cases, followed by influenza A and B, parainfluenza, human metapneumovirus and adenovirus [37] .\\n\\nMore recent meta-analyses of etiology data suggest a changing pathogen profile, with increasing recognition that clinical pneumonia is caused by the sequential or concurrent interaction of more than one organism. Severe disease in particular is often caused by multiple pathogens. With high coverage of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination and Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccination, viral pathogens increasingly predominate [38] . In recent case-control studies, at least one virus was detected in 87% of clinical pneumonia cases in South Africa [39] , while viruses were detected in 81% of radiologic pneumonia cases in Sweden [40] . In a large multi-center study in the United States, viral pathogens were detected in 73% of children hospitalized with radiologic pneumonia, while bacteria were detected in only 15% of cases [41] . A meta-analysis of 23 case-control studies of viral etiology in radiologically confirmed pneumonia in children, completed up to 2014, reported good evidence of causal attribution for respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, metapneumovirus and parainfluenza virus [42] . However there was no consistent evidence that many other commonly described viruses, including rhinovirus, adenovirus, bocavirus and coronavirus, were more commonly isolated from cases than from controls. Further attribution of bacterial etiology is difficult because it is often not possible to distinguish colonizing from pathogenic bacteria when they are isolated from nasal specimens [43] .\\n\\nAnother etiology is pertussis. In the last decade there has also been a resurgence in pertussis cases, especially in highincome countries [44] . Because pertussis immunity after acellular pertussis vaccination is less long-lasting than immunity after wild-type infection or whole-cell vaccination, many women of child-bearing age have waning pertussis antibody levels. Their infants might therefore be born with low transplacental anti-pertussis immunoglobulin G levels, making them susceptible to pertussis infection before completion of the primary vaccination series [45] . In 2014, more than 40,000 pertussis cases were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States; in some states, population-based incidence rates are higher than at any time in the last 70 years [44] . In contrast, most low-and middleincome countries use whole-cell pertussis vaccines and the numbers of pertussis cases in those countries were stable or decreasing until 2015 [46] . However recent evidence from South Africa (where the acellular vaccine is used) shows an appreciable incidence of pertussis among infants presenting with acute pneumonia: 2% of clinical pneumonia cases among infants enrolled in a birth cohort were caused by pertussis [39] , and 3.7% of infants and young children presenting to a tertiary academic hospital had evidence of pertussis infection [47] .\\n\\nSimilarly, childhood tuberculosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in many low-and middle-income countries, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis has increasingly been recognized as a pathogen in acute pneumonia in children living in high tuberculosis-prevalence settings. Postmortem studies of children dying from acute respiratory illness have commonly reported M. tuberculosis [48, 49] . A recent systematic review of tuberculosis as a comorbidity of childhood pneumonia reported culture-confirmed disease in about 8% of cases [50] . Because intrathoracic tuberculosis disease is only culture-confirmed in a minority of cases, the true burden could be even higher; tuberculosis could therefore be an important contributor to childhood pneumonia incidence and mortality in high-prevalence areas.\\n\\nChildhood pneumonia and clinically severe disease result from a complex interaction of host and environmental risk factors [37] . Because of the effectiveness of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination and Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccination for prevention of radiologic and clinical pneumonia, incomplete or inadequate vaccination must be considered as a major preventable risk factor for childhood pneumonia. Other risk factors include low birth weight, which is associated with 3.2 times increased odds of severe pneumonia in low-and middle-income countries, and 1.8 times increased odds in high-income countries [51] . Similarly, lack of exclusive breastfeeding for the first 4 months of life increases odds of severe pneumonia by 2.7 times in low-and middle-income countries and 1.3 times in highincome countries. Markers of undernutrition are strong risk factors for pneumonia in low-and middle-income countries only, with highly significant odds ratios for underweight for age (4.5), stunting (2.6) and wasting (2.8) . Household crowding has uniform risk, with odds ratios between 1.9 and 2.3 in both low-and middle-income countries and high-income countries. Indoor air pollution from use of solid or biomass fuels increases odds of pneumonia by 1.6 times; lack of measles vaccination by the end of the first year of age increases odds of pneumonia by 1.8 times [51] . It is estimated that the prevalence of these critical risk factors in low-and middle-income countries decreased by 25% between 2000 and 2010, contributing to reductions in pneumonia incidence and mortality in low-and middle-income countries, even in countries where conjugate vaccines have not been available [3] .\\n\\nThe single strongest risk factor for pneumonia is HIV infection, which is especially prevalent in children in sub-Saharan Africa. HIV-infected children have 6 times increased odds of developing severe pneumonia or of death compared to HIV-uninfected children [52] . Since the effective prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV, there is a growing population of HIV-exposed children who are uninfected; their excess risk of pneumonia, compared to HIV unexposed children, has been described as 1.3-to 3.4-fold higher [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] .\\n\\nThe pneumococcal conjugate vaccination and Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccination have been effective tools to decrease pneumonia incidence, severity and mortality [58, 59] . However, equitable coverage and access to vaccines remains sub-optimal. By the end of 2015, Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccination had been introduced in 73 countries, with global coverage estimated at 68%. However, inequities are still apparent among regions: in the Americas coverage is estimated at 90%, while in the Western Pacific it is only 25%. By 2015, pneumococcal conjugate vaccination had been introduced into 54 countries, with global coverage of 35% for three doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination for infant populations [60] . To address this issue, the WHO\\'s Global Vaccine Access Plan initiative was launched to make life-saving vaccines more equitably available. In addition to securing guarantees for financing of vaccines, the program objectives include building political will in low-and middle-income countries to commit to immunization as a priority, social marketing to individuals and communities, strengthening health systems and promoting relevant local research and development innovations [61] .\\n\\nMaternal vaccination to prevent disease in the youngest infants has been shown to be effective for tetanus, influenza and pertussis [62] . Influenza vaccination during pregnancy is safe, provides reasonable maternal protection against influenza, and also protects infants for a limited period from confirmed influenza infection (vaccine efficacy 63% in Bangladesh [63] and 50.4% in South Africa [64] ). However as antibody levels drop sharply after birth, infant protection does not persist much beyond 8 weeks [65] . Recently respiratory syncytial virus vaccination in pregnancy has been shown to be safe and immunogenic, and a phase-3 clinical trial of efficacy at preventing respiratory syncytial virus disease in infants is under way [66] . Within a decade, respiratory syncytial virus in infancy might be vaccine-preventable, with further decreases in pneumonia incidence, morbidity and mortality [67] .\\n\\nImproved access to health care, better nutrition and improved living conditions might contribute to further decreases in childhood pneumonia burden. The WHO Integrated Global Action Plan for diarrhea and pneumonia highlights many opportunities to protect, prevent and treat children [68] . Breastfeeding rates can be improved by programs that combine education and counseling interventions in homes, communities and health facilities, and by promotion of baby-friendly hospitals [69] . Improved home ventilation, cleaner cooking fuels and reduction in exposure to cigarette smoke are essential interventions to reduce the incidence and severity of pneumonia [70, 71] . Prevention of pediatric HIV is possible by providing interventions to prevent mother-to-child transmission [72] . Early infant HIV testing and early initiation of antiretroviral therapy and cotrimoxazole prophylaxis can substantially reduce the incidence of community-acquired pneumonia among HIV-infected children [73] . Community-based interventions reduce pneumonia mortality and have the indirect effect of improved-careseeking behavior [58] . If these cost-effective interventions were scaled up, it is estimated that 67% of pneumonia deaths in lowand middle-income countries could be prevented by 2025 [58] .\\n\\nCase management of pneumonia is a strategy by which severity of disease is classified as severe or non-severe. All children receive early, appropriate oral antibiotics, and severe cases are referred for parenteral antibiotics. When implemented in highburden areas before the availability of conjugate vaccines, case management as part of Integrated Management of Childhood Illness was associated with a 27% decrease in overall child mortality, and 42% decrease in pneumonia-specific mortality [74] . However the predominance of viral causes of pneumonia and low case fatality have prompted concern about overuse of antibiotics. Several randomized controlled trials comparing oral antibiotics to placebo for non-severe pneumonia have been performed [75] [76] [77] and others are ongoing [78] . In two studies, performed in Denmark and in India, outcomes of antibiotic and placebo treatments were equivalent [76, 77] . In the third study, in Pakistan, there was a non-significant 24% vs. 20% rate of failure in the placebo group, which was deemed to be non-equivalent to the antibiotic group [75] . Furthermore, because WHO-classified non-severe pneumonia and bronchiolitis might be considered within a spectrum of lower respiratory disease, many children with clinical pneumonia could actually have viral bronchiolitis, for which antibiotics are not beneficial [79] . This has been reflected in British [33] and Spanish [31] national pneumonia guidelines, which do not recommend routine antibiotic treatment for children younger than 2 years with evidence of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination who present with non-severe pneumonia. The United States\\' national guidelines recommend withholding antibiotics in children up to age 5 years presenting with non-severe pneumonia [32] . However, given the high mortality from pneumonia in low-and middle-income countries, the lack of easy access to care, and the high prevalence of risk factors for severe disease, revised World Health Organization pneumonia guidelines still recommend antibiotic treatment for all children who meet the WHO pneumonia case definitions [80] .\\n\\nUse of supplemental oxygen is life-saving, but this is not universally available in low-and middle-income countries; it is estimated that use of supplemental oxygen systems could reduce mortality of children with hypoxic pneumonia by 20% [81] . Identifying systems capacity to increase availability of oxygen in health facilities, and identifying barriers to further implementation are among the top 15 priorities for future childhood pneumonia research [82] . However, up to 81% of pneumonia deaths in 2010 occurred outside health facilities [5] , so there are major challenges with access to health services and health-seeking behavior of vulnerable populations. Identifying and changing the barriers to accessing health care is an important area with the potential to impact the survival and health of the most vulnerable children [82] .\\n\\nMuch progress has been made in decreasing deaths caused by childhood pneumonia. Improved socioeconomic status and vaccinations, primarily the conjugate vaccines (against Haemophilus influenzae and pneumococcus), have led to substantial reductions in the incidence and severity of childhood pneumonia. Stronger strategies to prevent and manage HIV have reduced HIV-associated pneumonia deaths. However, despite the substantial changes in incidence, etiology and radiology globally, there remain inequities in access to care and availability of effective interventions, especially in low-and middle-income countries. Effective interventions need to be more widely available and new interventions developed for the residual burden of childhood pneumonia.'}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'be102f9266cc2cc6836463283a6d4560'}>,\n",

Dysregulation of the antibody response can lead to an autoimmune disease, malignancy, or enhanced infection. Since the experimental delineation of a distinct B cell lineage in 1965, various methods have been developed to understand antigen-specific B cell responses in the context of autoimmune diseases, primary immunodeficiencies, infection, and vaccination. In this review, we summarize the established techniques and discuss new and emerging technologies for probing the B cell response in vitro and in vivo by taking advantage of the specificity of B cell receptor (BCR)-associated and secreted antibodies. These include ELISPOT, flow cytometry, mass cytometry, and fluorescence microscopy to identify and/or isolate primary antigen-specific B cells. We also present our approach to identify rare antigen-specific B cells using magnetic enrichment followed by flow cytometry. Once these cells are isolated, in vitro proliferation assays and adoptive transfer experiments in mice can be used to further characterize antigen-specific B cell activation, function, and fate. Transgenic mouse models of B cells targeting model antigens and of B cell signaling have also significantly advanced our understanding of antigen-specific B cell responses in vivo.\\n\\nText: In his Nobel lecture in 1908, Paul Ehrlich likened the antibody-antigen interaction to a lock and key. He reasoned that antitoxins (antibodies) contained in a solution in the serum of immunized animals must be identical to a cellular receptor \"for a really well-made key will not open different locks at the same time\" (1) . It took almost five decades before immunofluorescence microscopy was used to confirm the cellular origin of antibodies (2) . Major strides in the B cell and antibody field followed in the 1970s with the development of hybridoma technology to produce monoclonal antibodies and the discovery that somatic rearrangement during B cell differentiation was responsible for antibody diversification (3, 4) . The subsequent explosion of available monoclonal antibodies led to revolutionary diagnostic, therapeutic, and research reagents to distinguish different types of immune cells (5) . Together, these discoveries have allowed us to probe humoral immunity at the level of the antigen-specific B cell.\\n\\nMethods to probe the antigen-specific B cell response have advanced our understanding of how to harness the remarkable breadth of the B cell repertoire and the exquisite specificity of the individual B cell in developing (1) vaccine candidates that elicit protective antibodies; (2) antibodies that prevent disease when given prophylactically; and (3) antibodies that can be given as therapy after the onset of disease. Many of the vaccines currently available were originally developed empirically either by inactivating, attenuating, or administering a subunit of the pathogen. However, vaccine development against pathogens that are traditionally difficult to vaccinate against may rely on a deeper investigation of the B cell response to the antigens exposed on the surface of these pathogens.\\n\\nFor HIV-1, the discovery of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) that protect against infection across diverse viral isolates has intensified efforts to understand the developmental pathway of the rare B cells that produce these antibodies (6) (7) (8) (9) . Insights into the ontogeny of these rare B cells could allow the design of a step-wise vaccine regimen that stimulates the germ-line precursor to expand and mature to produce circulating bnAbs which could protect against HIV acquisition (10, 11) . For RSV, stabilized versions of the fusion (F) protein in the pre-fusion conformation have led to insights in the B cell\\'s response to infection and has generated potentially safer and more efficacious vaccine candidates (12, 13) . Influenza also performs fusion through the stem region of the hemagglutinin protein, and the identification of B cells that target this relatively conserved site has spurred research on the development of a universal influenza vaccine (14) (15) (16) . Like RSV, HIV, and influenza, the fusion proteins of EBV and CMV exist in a pre-fusion conformation, and stabilization in their pre-fusion states could greatly accelerate vaccine development against these pathogens (17-19). Rare memory B cells producing antibodies specific for the EBV fusion machinery have been isolated; these can neutralize both B cell and epithelial cell infection (20). A new paradigm in malaria vaccine development is also emerging with the discovery of IgM+ and IgD+ memory B cells targeting the Merozoite Surface Protein 1, that rapidly respond to malaria re-infection (21). Further, highly potent neutralizing antibodies targeting a novel and conserved site on the Circumsporozoite Protein have been isolated from B cells (22). Together, these examples demonstrate the importance of studying antigen-specific humoral responses to infectious diseases. The solutions to the crystal structures of surface proteins for a variety of pathogens, the conformational stabilization of these antigens, and the application of the methods summarized in this review, to probe antigen-specific B cell responses, have created new opportunities for systematic and rational vaccine design for HIV, RSV, EBV, malaria, and many other pathogens.\\n\\nThe study of B cell responses has not only informed vaccine design but has also advanced our understanding of antibodymediated autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus (23, 24). Up to 20% of mature, naïve B cells have receptors with the capacity to bind self-antigens (25). Although these cells are potentially pathogenic, the deletion of B cells with high affinity to self-antigen through apoptosis, anergy of B cells with low affinity to self-antigen, and the absence of T cell help combine together to protect against autoimmune disease in mice (26). The study of autoantigen-specific B cells and a detailed analysis of B cell subsets with pathogenic potential in humans could lead to a better understanding of how to prevent and treat autoimmune diseases.\\n\\nAlthough the term antigen-specific B cell is used throughout this mini-review to denote the analysis of B cells based on binding between the B cell receptor (BCR) and a specific antigen used as bait, it is important to keep in mind that BCRs within the polyclonal B cell repertoire exhibit a spectrum of polyreactivity. On one end of the spectrum, a highly polyreactive BCR is able to bind multiple structurally unrelated antigens with physiologically relevant affinities. The frequency of polyreactivity in the normal adult human B cell repertoire has been estimated to be 4% of naïve B cells, 23% of IgG+ memory B cells, and 26% of intestinal IgA+ and IgG+ plasmablasts (27-29). On the other end of the spectrum, a mono reactive BCR is activated only when it encounters a single cognate antigen. Although there are exceptions, the accumulation of somatic hypermutations within the variable regions of the BCR during the process of affinity maturation is generally thought to lead to increased affinity and specificity for the cognate antigen (30, 31).\\n\\nSeveral general techniques are commonly used to identify antigen-specific B cells ( Table 1 ). The B cell enzyme linked immunospot (ELISPOT) technique relies on the principle of capturing the secreted antibody in the vicinity of each cell. In the B cell ELISPOT, antibody secreting B cells (ASCs) present in a sample or differentiated in vitro are added to plates coated with the antigen of interest. Antigen-specific antibodies will bind in close proximity to the location of the individual B cells producing those antibodies. Enzyme or fluorescent labeled secondary antibodies are then used to visualize spots of antibody secretion and binding to plate-bound antigen at the location of the ASCs. Each spot corresponds to antibody produced from a single antigen-specific B cell and therefore the technique is extremely sensitive. Secondary antibodies conjugated to combinatorial colored beads can also be used to detect the antibodies secreted from individual B cells with the advantage of multiplexing the assay (32). One limitation of the assay is its requirement for antibody secretion by B cells thereby limiting the assay to only a subset of B cells in the repertoire, namely ASCs (33). Memory B cells can be stimulated in vitro to differentiate into ASCs prior to addition to the antigen-coated plate (34) . Further, the antigenspecific B cells identified by ELISPOT are generally not available for downstream analysis.\\n\\nLimiting dilution is another technique that has been used to isolate antigen-specific B cells. In this approach, primary cells can be diluted serially until individual B cells are separated in microwell plates (36) . The B cells can then be cultured and expanded ex vivo and/or immortalized using EBV such that each well contains a monoclonal antibody (3, 37, 38) . Antigen-specific B cells can be selected by screening the culture supernatants for monoclonal antibodies that bind an antigen of interest. Although antibodies can be sequenced and cloned, the requirement for an ex vivo culture prior to selection precludes determination of the transcriptional profile of the original B cell in this approach. This technique can potentially be time-consuming and laborious, but the use of microfluidics and robotics has greatly improved the throughput for selecting antigen-specific B cells (39) . Advances in single cell next generation sequencing technology have allowed high throughput transcriptional profiling and sequencing of paired immunoglobulin heavy and light chains (40) . In this approach, antigen specificity can be tested after monoclonal antibodies are cloned and produced using the sequencing data. This method can be useful in identifying antigen-specific B cells that have undergone clonal expansion after vaccination or acute infection (41) . Flow cytometry is the most common method used for single cell analysis and isolation (39) . Flow cytometry-based analysis of antigen-specific B cells is dependent on labeling antigen with a fluorescent tag to allow detection. Fluorochromes can either be attached covalently via chemical conjugation to the antigen, expressed as a recombinant fusion protein, or attached non-covalently by biotinylating the antigen. After biotinylation, fluorochrome-conjugated streptavidin is added to generate a labeled tetramer of the antigen. Biotinylation of the antigen at a ratio ≤1 biotin to 1 antigen is important, since each streptavidin has the potential to bind four biotins. If the ratio of biotin to antigen is >1:1, then clumping and precipitation of the antigen out of solution can occur as soon as streptavidin is added. Alternatively, site directed biotinylation can be accomplished by adding either an AviTag or BioEase tag to the recombinant antigen prior to expression (77, 78) . When site-specific biotinylation is utilized, researchers must keep in mind that the tag may occlude an epitope from recognition by B cells which can be problematic for vaccine antigens. Further, for proteins that oligomerize, multiple tags may be incorporated, possibly resulting in aggregation.\\n\\nAnother important consideration is the potential for confounding by B cells in the repertoire that bind to the fluorochrome, streptavidin, or any linkers rather than to the antigen of interest. Binding between fluorochromes, linkers, or streptavidin and BCRs from humans and mice never exposed to these antigens are generally of low affinity, and these BCRs are generally expressed by naïve and potentially polyreactive B cells (62, 79, 80) . Dual labeling, in which the same antigen is separately labeled with two different fluorochromes, can be used to identify double positive B cells and remove confounding by B cells that bind the fluorochrome (12, 42) . However, even when tetramers are utilized for dual labeling, streptavidin-specific B cells will contaminate the double positive population. To fully remove confounding from the fluorochrome, streptavidin, and linkers, a \"decoy\" tetramer can be used to identify these contaminating B cells (21, 26). In this approach, the same fluorochrome used to identify antigen-specific B cells is conjugated to a different fluorochrome such that the emission spectrum is altered by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) (26). Decoy-binding B cells can therefore be excluded from the true antigen-specific B cells. Notably, it is critical to use the same source of fluorochrome conjugated streptavidin in the tetramer and decoy reagent, because conjugation methods, recombinant streptavidin, and protein fluorochromes like R-phycoerythrin vary enough from company to company to alter some of the epitopes available for B cells to bind.\\n\\nOne weakness of the flow cytometric approach is the reliance on antigens that can be readily conjugated to a fluorochrome or biotinylated. In addition to recombinant proteins and synthesized peptides, labeled polysaccharides, lipids, haptens, virus-like particles, and pseudo viruses have also been used to identify antigen-specific cells by flow cytometry (33, [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] . Further, epitope-specific B cells have been identified by screening bacteriophage-displays or microarray peptide libraries with polyclonal antibodies targeting the native antigen to select conformational epitopes that can be fused to fluorescent proteins for use in flow cytometry (47, 60) .\\n\\nWith technologic advancements increasing the number of simultaneously measurable parameters, antigen-specific B cells can be further characterized by cell surface markers and intracellular staining. Additionally, the immunoglobulin capture assay is a flow cytometry-based adaptation of the ELISPOT assay in which a streptavidin-conjugated anti-CD45 antibody carrying four biotinylated anti-IgG antibodies is used to simultaneously bind plasmablasts and capture secreted antibody followed by fluorescent-labeled antigen to detect antigenspecific plasmablasts (61) . The mean fluorescence intensity measured by flow cytometry and normalized to the level of BCR expression also provides a measure of the relative amount of antigen binding to a B cell and can be used as a rough surrogate for binding affinity (79, 81, 82) . Preincubation of B cells with increasing concentrations of a monomeric antigen prior to labeling with tetrameric antigen can also be used to further quantify binding affinity. Cells expressing high affinity BCRs will bind monomeric antigen at low concentrations, whereas low affinity BCRs will require higher concentrations of monomeric antigen to compete with and inhibit tetramer binding (26). Individual cells can also be isolated by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) for downstream analysis, including BCR sequencing and cloning, BCR affinity measurement, in vitro proliferation, and transcriptional profiling. \\n\\nMethods have recently been developed to further improve the sensitivity for detecting rare antigen-specific B cells. Magnetic nanoparticles conjugated to antibodies targeting the fluorochrome on the antigen of interest, allow for the enrichment of antigen-specific B cells prior to flow cytometry (20, 26, 80, 83) . This approach is particularly useful for detecting rare antigenspecific naïve B cells, autoreactive B cells, memory B cells, and plasmablasts (21, 26, 47, 50) . The magnetic enrichment strategy allows for the analysis of significantly more cells in a shorter period of time by concentrating the cells of interest prior to flow cytometry (Figure 1) . Notably, as with any method that seeks to identify a population of cells at a very low frequency, the background and noise inherent in the detection system is magnified with respect to the signal of interest, especially when that signal is weak. Therefore, to detect the antigen-specific population of interest, the following considerations are critical: (1) Using decoys to exclude B cells of unwanted specificities;\\n\\n(2) careful design of flow cytometry panels to avoid emission spillover into the channel for the antigen of interest; and (3) choosing the brightest fluorochromes, like R-phycoerythrin or allophycocyanin.\\n\\nIn vivo methods to probe antigen-specific B cell responses in the presence of other antigen-presenting cells and T cell helpers, have increased our mechanistic understanding of the humoral immune response during vaccination, infection, and autoimmunity. Adoptively transferred B cells can be distinguished from recipient lymphocytes by taking advantage of mouse strains with allelic variations in CD45 or mice devoid of B cells. The adoptively transferred B cells can come from wildtype mice or from mice expressing transgenic BCRs ( Table 2) , and antigen-specific B cells can be analyzed using the techniques described above.\\n\\nMicroscopy is another general technique that has been used to identify antigen-specific cells in vivo and offers the advantage of direct visualization. In the first reported application of this technique to demonstrate the cellular origin of antibodies in 1955, fluorescein-conjugated antibodies against ovalbumin and human immunoglobulin were used to stain tissue sections of the spleen from hyperimmune rabbits (2) . Since then, other groups have fluorescently labeled antigens to localize antigen-specific B cells by microscopy (62, 65) . Advances in laser capture dissection microscopy, already used in the T cell field, also provide an opportunity for isolating individual antigen-specific B cells for downstream analysis, including sequencing and cloning of the BCR or transcriptional profiling (66) . However, antigen staining of BCRs in situ can be challenging depending on the binding of antigens from pathogens to other cellular receptors or an alteration of BCR specificity during tissue fixation or processing. Two-photon or multiphoton microscopy has the ability to resolve images at greater depths and with less photobleaching than confocal microscopy (67, 68) . As a result, this technology has allowed real-time imaging in living, intact lymphoid tissues of mice, permitting the direct in vivo observation of immune cell interactions. The dynamic movements and interactions of antigen-specific B cells can be studied in vivo by combining an adoptive transfer of individual B cells (isolated by limiting dilution or FACS) with two-photon microscopy (63, 69, 70) .\\n\\nHumanized mouse models are powerful tools for translating experiments in mice to applications in humans. Transgenic mice that produce humanized cytokines by knock-in replacement can be used to support human hematopoietic stem cells (104) . Transgenic mice with complete humanization of the mouse immunoglobulin loci provide an opportunity for recapitulating the breadth of the human B cell repertoire and serve as a valuable tool for therapeutic antibody discovery (71) . However, one caveat is that the allele frequencies found in the B cell repertoires of these mouse models may not necessarily recapitulate those found in humans (72) . Mass cytometry has the potential to provide further high-dimensional analysis of antigen-specific B cells. In this method, heavy metal ion tags rather than fluorochromes are used to label cells. Since data is collected as time-offlight mass spectrometry, up to 42 unique parameters can be simultaneously measured from a single sample without significant spillover between channels or the need for compensation. Mass cytometry with heavy metal-labeled tetramers can be constructed using streptavidin (73) . Mass cytometry with metal-labeled peptide-MHC tetramers has been used successfully to identify and characterize antigen-specific T cells, but to our knowledge has not yet been applied to antigen-specific B cells (73, 74) . One limitation of this approach is that cells are unavailable for downstream analysis since they are vaporized by a plasma torch to atomize the ion tags. However, by simultaneously detecting many more surface markers and intracellular cytokines, transcription factors, and detecting more signaling molecules from individual cells than previously possible with traditional fluorescent labels, the application of mass cytometry with dimensionality reduction algorithms could help dissect the complexity of the B cell compartment, provide a higher resolution view of B cell development, and reveal novel subsets of antigen-specific B cells involved in mediating autoimmune diseases or protection against infection.\\n\\nOn the horizon, single cell RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) technologies have the potential to revolutionize the study of antigen-specific immune cells (75, 76) . The ability to generate a library of tetramers with unique barcodes could allow the simultaneous examination of gene expression profiles from a large number of cells with different antigen specificities in a single experiment. Combining barcoded tetramers with oligonucleotide-conjugated antibodies and RNA-seq to simultaneously measure the protein and gene expression of antigen-specific cells could further increase the amount of unbiased multi-omic information about individual antigen-specific cells in normal and disease states and aid the rational design of vaccines and therapeutics (105) (106) (107) .\\n\\nThe ongoing analysis of antigen-specific B cell responses has led to the development of new diagnostic, therapeutic, and research reagents. Methods for studying antigen-specific B cell responses are being increasingly applied to tackle diseases like HIV, RSV, and autoimmune diseases, in which the immune response either fails to protect or clear disease, or where it enhances disease or is responsible for the disease itself. Considerable opportunities exist on the horizon for applying these methods to a myriad of diseases in which B cells play an active role.\\n\\nJB and JT reviewed the literature, generated figures and tables, and wrote the manuscript.'}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '4ba2436a4a752d6ac4e6f4b07e390ad6'}>,\n",

METHODS: In our study, 102 volunteers experiencing upper airway infection were recruited over the winter and early spring of 2008/2009 and the first half of the winter of 2009/2010. Ninety-nine EBCs were successfully obtained and screened for 14 commonly circulating respiratory viruses. To investigate the efficiency of virus isolation from EBC, a nasal swab was taken in parallel from a subset of volunteers. The combined use of the ECoVent device with the RTube™ allowed the registration of the exhaled volume and breathing frequency during collection. In this way, the number of exhaled viral particles per liter air or per minute can theoretically be estimated. RESULTS: Viral screening resulted in the detection of 4 different viruses in EBC and/or nasal swabs: Rhinovirus, Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus B, Influenza A and Influenza B. Rhinovirus was detected in 6 EBCs and 1 EBC was Influenza B positive. We report a viral detection rate of 7% for the EBCs, which is much lower than the detection rate of 46.8% observed using nasal swabs. CONCLUSION: Although very promising, EBC collection using the RTube™ is not reliable for diagnosis of respiratory infections.\\n\\nText: Human respiratory tract infections represent the most commonly encountered infections worldwide. In the majority of cases, the etiology of these infections remains undetermined due to rapid convalescence after infection. Respiratory tract infections in healthy adults can be caused by a variety of pathogens and the detection of these agents is currently based on their isolation from nasal swabs (NS), bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL), nasopharyngeal aspirates and sputum samples. The acquisition of these specimens by semi-invasive and invasive techniques is often unpleasant for the patient. Therefore, exhaled breath condensate (EBC) analysis has recently been explored as a new and non-invasive method to monitor lung inflammation and pulmonary disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, cystic fibrosis, lung cancer etc. EBCs mainly consist of water vapour but a small fraction contains respiratory droplets derived from the airway lining fluid [1, 2] . This observation has created a growing interest in the use of EBC as a new sampling method for the screening of respiratory viruses infecting the upper airways. At first, investigators suspected that turbulence of the inhaled air was responsible for the aerosolisation of the respiratory fluid. However, the effect of the turbulent airflow is limited to the upper airways since the turbulent airflow becomes laminar as it reaches the smaller bronchial airways and alveoli. Recently, the bronchiole fluid film burst model has been described [3] . This model suggests that aerosols are produced during inhalation by the bursting of fluid bubbles present in the bronchioles.\\n\\nThe aim of this study was to investigate whether the EBC collection method was suited for the efficient condensation of aerosolised virus particles during normal breathing and to explore the isolation of respiratory viruses in the condensate. Therefore we screened the EBC samples with virus specific PCR assays targeting 14 \\n\\nIn this study, 102 EBCs were collected from otherwise healthy volunteers showing respiratory or flu-like symptoms (defined in Table 1 ), using a commercially available condenser (RTube™, Respiratory Research Inc., Charlottesville, Virginia, USA). The patient was instructed to breath orally at tidal volumes into a mouthpiece attached to a condenser for 10 minutes. No nose clips were used during collection and saliva contamination was avoided by the presence of a one-way valve and the T-shaped section of the mouthpiece.\\n\\nIn a first part of the study that started during the winter and spring of 2008/2009, 70 EBC samples were collected from patients who voluntary presented themselves to our laboratory. The majority of these volunteers were students that responded to the information leaflet, distributed in the university buildings of the Catholic University of Leuven. The samples were collected with the aluminium cooler sleeve chilled at -80°C.\\n\\nIn the fall and first half of the winter of 2009/2010, 32 condensates were collected from patients who presented themselves to their general practitioner. Due to practical circumstances, the condensates were collected with the cooler chilled at -20°C. For 13 out of 32 collections, the RTube™ was connected by a custom made connectingpiece to the ECoVent (Jaeger, Germany). This device registers ventilatory parameters such as the exhaled volume, breathing frequency and tidal volume. Additionally, a NS was obtained in parallel with the condensate collection from each patient.\\n\\nAll EBCs were immediately stored at -20°C. Nasal swabs (NS) were refrigerated. After viral DNA and RNA extraction, EBC samples and nasal swabs were stored at -80°C. Three specimens were excluded from the study due to incorrect condensate collection. A short questionnaire was used to document the date of birth, the severity of respiratory complaints and to record the days of symptomatic illness from all volunteers. This study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the University Hospital of Leuven and informed consents were received from all participants.\\n\\nViral DNA and RNA were isolated with the QIAamp MinElute Virus kit (Qiagen, Westburg, The Netherlands) according to the instruction manual. EBC extracts were eluted in 60 μl elution buffer and NS extracts in 110 μl elution buffer.\\n\\nThe breath condensates were screened for 11 respiratory RNA viruses (CoV NL63, E229 and OC43, RV, HMPV, InfA&B and PIV1-4) [4] [5] [6] [7] using a OneStep RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen, Westburg, The Netherlands) in a 50 μl reaction containing 10 μl of the extracted RNA, 0.6 μM of forward and reverse primers (Table 2), 1.5 μl One Step Enzyme Mix, 10 μl 5 × One Step RT-PCR Buffer and 400 μM of each dNTP. For adenovirus screening, a DNA PCR was carried out for which the amplification reaction mix contained 0.5 μM forward primer (AdFW) and reverse primer (AdRV), 0.4 mM dNTPs, 10 μl Buffer C and 1 U Taq polymerase in a final volume of 50 μl. The PCR primers used were located in conserved regions of the genomes of the respiratory pathogens ( Table 2 ). The reactions were carried out in a T3000 Thermocycler 48 (Westburg, Leusden, The Netherlands) with an initial reverse transcription step for RNA viruses at 50°C for 30 min, followed by PCR activation at 95°C for 30 s, 45 cycles of amplification followed by a final extension step for 10 min at 72°C. The DNA amplification program was initiated with a denaturation step at 94°C for 3 min, followed by 45 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s and a final extension step at 72°C for 1 min. The amplicons were subjected to a 6% polyacrylamide gel and visualised under UV light by staining with ethidium bromide. PCR products were purified using the Invitek MSB Spin PCRapace Kit and cycle sequenced in forward and reverse direction using the ABI PRISM Big-Dye Termination Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Sequence analysis was performed with the ABI3130 Genetic Analyser (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Consensus sequences were obtained using the SeqMan II software (DNASTAR, Madison, Wis.). For samples from HRSV was detected using a RT-PCR assay as previously described [8, 9] . In brief, a multiplex mix was prepared in a final volume of 25 μl using 5 μl extracted RNA, 12.5 μl of Eurogentec One-Step Reverse Transcriptase qPCR Master Mix containing ROX as a passive reference, 0.125 μl Euroscript + RT & RNase inhibitor (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium) 200 nM of HRSV-A and -B specific forward and reverse primers and 100 nM of HRSV-A and -B MGB probes. cRNA standards were constructed using the MEGAshortscript T7 kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) and spectrophotometrically quantified.\\n\\nThe viral load of RV positive samples were quantified by qRT-PCR as described in the manuscript published by Lu and coworkers [10] . The Eurogentec One-Step Reverse Transcriptase qPCR kit was used for preparation of the master mix as described above.

Quantification was performed with a spectrophotometer at 260 nm and converted to the molecule number [11] . Tenfold serial dilutions, allowing detection in a range of 8.6 × 10 6 to 8.6 × 10 2 RNA copies were used. The RT-PCR assays were carried out on a ABI PRISM 7500 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). An initial reverse transcription step was performed at 48°C for 30 min, followed by a denaturation step at 95°C for 10 min. Finally, an amplification step of 45 cycli at 95°C for 15 sec and 1 min at 60°C was completed. (37.5%) men, with a median age of 29 (range 9 -46 years). Age and gender was missing for 2 participants of the second group. In total, 52% of the participants were between 20-30 years old. Only 6% were younger than 20 years old and 3% were older than 70 years. In totality, 80 patients (78.4%) were already feeling ill for 1 to 7 days at the day the sample was obtained. Seven volunteers (6.8%) were symptomatic for 8 to 14 days and 9 participants (8.8%) were already ill for more than 14 days at the day of sample collection. Data on the duration of symptoms was lacking for 6 patients. Almost all volunteers experienced at least 2 symptoms except for two patients (Table 1) . Forty-seven (46.1%) volunteers complained about a constant runny or stuffy nose, 43 (42.2%) had frequent sneezing events and 38 (37.3%) participants had a serious sore throat (Table 1) .\\n\\nIn a first part of the study, we collected 70 EBCs. Screening of the EBCs for 14 respiratory viruses (Table 2) , showed 5 RV (7.1%) positive samples (Table 3 ). In a second part, we collected 32 EBCs from patients that presented themselves to their general practitioner. Two of these EBCs were positive for one of the 14 investigated respiratory viruses, 1 for RV and 1 for InfB. To inspect the detection rate of respiratory viruses in the condensate, a NS was taken from this second group of volunteers for comparison. In 15 out of 32 NS (46.8%), one or more viral pathogens were isolated. Viral screening of the NS resulted in the detection of RV, InfA (subtype H1N1) and HRSV-B. Quantification of the HRSV-B viral load demonstrated for samples 72 and 101 viral titers of 8.0 × 10 4 RNA copies/ml and 6.8 × 10 7 RNA copies/ml respectively. The RV RT-PCR assay did not allow the quantification of all samples that tested positive for RV by PCR ( Table 3) . Presence of the same pathogen in both the EBC and the NS was confirmed for only 1 sample: sample 71, which tested positive for RV in both the EBC and the NS. For sample 81, RV was detected in the NS and analysis of the EBC demonstrated an InfB infection.\\n\\nFor EBC samples that were collected in the fall and winter of 2009/2010, measurements with the ECoVent in (Table 3 , sample 81) was positive for InfB when using the RTube™ in combination with the EcoVent. In theory, the viral generation rate (number of viral RNA copies exhaled per minute) can be predicted by quantification of the exhaled viral load. Then, an estimation of the RNA copies per litre exhaled air or per minute can be calculated. Quantification of the exhaled InfB would allow us to predict the generation rate for this virus. Due to insufficient sample volume, we could not determine the number of RNA copies in the sample.\\n\\nCollection of exhaled breath condensates is a novel and non-invasive method for obtaining samples of the upper respiratory tract. The collection of EBC is easy to perform and can be conducted in a home environment. This method is much more agreeable for the patient when compared to the unpleasant and invasive collection of nasal swabs, BAL, aspirates, etc. This aspect renders the method very attractive for routine laboratory diagnostics of viral infections. Most studies that perform breath analyses for viral detection use modified face masks, with a removable central region in electret or a removable Teflon filter on which exhaled particles impact [12] [13] [14] . With the RTube™ collection device, aerosolized particles of the airway lining fluid are precipitated into a condensate when the breath is cooled which serves as an immediate starting point for molecular testing.\\n\\nUntil now, this is the study with the largest subset of volunteers that investigated EBC as a specimen for the detection of respiratory viruses. Previous studies reported the inclusion of a limited subset of participants and investigated the presence of a limited number of viruses in the breath samples. The study performed by Fabian and colleagues, included 12 volunteers [12] . Huynh and co-workers recruited 9 volunteers for exhaled breath sampling [13] . In the study by Stelzer-Braid et al., 50 EBCs were analysed [14] and St-George et al. report the participation of 12 adults [15] . These studies have focused on the detection of InfA and -B, PIV1-3, HRSV and HMPV, while we have screened the samples for a panel of 14 commonly circulating respiratory viruses. Based on the analysis of 99 EBCs (3 EBCs were excluded), our results support the exhalation of RV and InfB in 7% of our samples. Since many of the volunteers had already been experiencing symptoms for 1 to 7 days, we initially presumed that they were already recovering from the infection and were no longer exhaling the virus. For common cold infections it is suggested that a person may already be infectious for 1 or 2 days before experiencing any symptoms. However, in a second part of our study we started collecting EBCs in parallel with nasal swabs from patients presenting themselves to their medical doctor, 1 to 3 days after onset of symptoms. Only for 1 condensate the same pathogen was detected in both the EBC and the NS. The detection rate for respiratory viral pathogens in the NS was 46.8% which is much higher than the 7% detection rate in the EBCs. The low detection of virus positive condensates can therefore not be attributed to the fact that volunteers were no longer infectious. The discrepant detection rate between samples may also be explained by different severity of respiratory infection, since comparator samples were of different parts of the respiratory tract. Patients that delivered a positive NS may have possibly suffered from an upper airway infection whereas EBC positive volunteers may have experienced a more advanced, lower respiratory tract infection. However, the effect of nasal inhalation on EBC collection, guiding formed particles in the upper respiratory tract to the lower compartments, in stead of oral inhalation was not investigated. Patients with positive EBC samples were experiencing symptoms for maximum two days at the time of collection. However, this was not different for 7 patients with positive NS. Six patients that provided positive NS were experiencing symptoms for a longer period at the time of collection (Table 3 ). In the group of volunteers that provided an EBC negative or EBC and NS negative sample, the manifestation of symptoms were reported ranging from 1 day to more than two weeks. When reported symptoms were compared between EBC positive patients (7) and NS positive patients (15) , 27% and 33% in the positive NS group experienced shivering and muscle pain whereas this symptom was not indicated by any patient of the EBC positive group. In all groups fever, headache, watering eyes, stuffed nose, frequent sneezing, sore throat and coughing were reported.\\n\\nVolunteers were not diagnosed with other pathogens before participation in the study. Since we did not test these samples for other than viral pathogens, we can not exclude the possibility that some of the negative NS are positive for bacteria or other pathogens causing respiratory illness. Recently, one study reported a detection rate of 5% for influenza in EBC [15] . This is in the same range of the detection rate that we report for respiratory viruses in general. Other studies with a limited number of patients, describe a markedly higher sensitivity of 33 to 36% [12] [13] [14] but the higher percentage may be due to the low number of participants subjects were included [12] . Remarkably, the studies reporting this higher detection rate used collections masks, while the study using the RTube™ reported comparable findings. Face masks consist of electret which trap viruses based on permanently charged fibres [13] . In addition, the Teflon filter has 2 μm pores which will retain all larger particles. Possibly, the lower detection rate can partly be explained by the fact that the RTube™ is manufactured in polypropylene and does not possess a virus attracting and filtering feature like the aforementioned materials.\\n\\nThe qRT-PCR developed by Lu and coworkers for the detection of RV, did not allow the assessment of the viral load present in the EBC samples [10] . Also for 4 NS, the viral titer remained undetermined, probably due to the limited sensitivity of the assay. For diagnosis, more sensitive methods might be necessary to detect respiratory viruses present in EBC since it is unpredictable how diluted the viral particles in the specimen are. Recently, nested qRT-PCR assays have been developed to allow a more sensitive detection of viruses in aerosols [16] .\\n\\nAlso person-dependent factors, such as the number of particles produced, the exhaled volume and the age of the patient, have been suggested to play an important role for exhalation of viral particles. The participants that were recruited in the study of Fabian and coworkers were 12 years of age and older [12] . For hospitalized children a much higher rate of virus positive samples is reported [14] . In our study, the majority of volunteers were between 20 and 30 years old. Only two children less than 10 years and 3 elderly people (> 70 years) were included. One of the children tested positive for InfA in the NS, but the infection was not confirmed in the EBC.\\n\\nFor influenza, an exhaled generation rate of <3.2 to 20 influenza RNA copies per minute was predicted by quantifying the virus aerosols that impacted on a removable Teflon filter of a collection mask [12] . We used the RTube™ in combination with the ECoVent, that allowed the registration of additional ventilation parameters such as breathing frequency and exhaled volume. In this way, when the number of RNA copies in the EBC is quantified, the amount of viral particles that are exhaled per litre or per minute can be estimated. Unfortunately, we were not able to predict a virus generation rate for InfB since viral load remained undetermined.\\n\\nAlthough an inventive, new and promising method, EBC collected by the RTube™ does not appear to be appropriate for diagnosis of respiratory infections. Nonetheless, this method may provide an alternative for current sample procurement for epidemiological studies of circulating viruses. This technique also confirms the observation that viruses are able to disseminate through normal breathing, particularly RV.\\n\\nIn addition, EBC collection from patients during respiratory infections may be further investigated for biomarker patterns. In calves that were experimentally infected with bovine RSV, an increase in leukotriene B 4 , indicating oxidative stress, was observed. This increased level was also associated with the development of bronchial hyperresponsiveness [17] . In humans, a transiently elevated H 2 O 2 level was observed during common cold infection. This marker returned to baseline values when volunteers recovered from infection. H 2 O 2 has also been recognized as an interesting marker in asthma, where it is associated with chronic lower airway inflammation [18] . In InfA infected volunteers, an increased CO level was observed during upper respiratory infection. This observation might imply that CO is an indicator of airway inflammation or represents one of the host defence mechanisms against viral infection [19] . Therefore, a better identification of the biomarker signature in condensates of individuals experiencing a viral infection might imply interesting findings towards the identification of markers reflecting inflammation or antiviral protection. This may contribute to the biomarker profiles established for diseases like asthma and COPD, for which viral infections are suggested to trigger or exacerbate symptoms [20] .\"}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '98025000945332c583dc6ea06f2603cc'}>,\n",

OBJECTIVE: To assess the magnitude of mental health outcomes and associated factors among health care workers treating patients exposed to COVID-19 in China. DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional, survey-based, region-stratified study collected demographic data and mental health measurements from 1257 health care workers in 34 hospitals from January 29, 2020, to February 3, 2020, in China. Health care workers in hospitals equipped with fever clinics or wards for patients with COVID-19 were eligible. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The degree of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress was assessed by the Chinese versions of the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, the 7-item Insomnia Severity Index, and the 22-item Impact of Event Scale–Revised, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with mental health outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 1257 of 1830 contacted individuals completed the survey, with a participation rate of 68.7%. A total of 813 (64.7%) were aged 26 to 40 years, and 964 (76.7%) were women. Of all participants, 764 (60.8%) were nurses, and 493 (39.2%) were physicians; 760 (60.5%) worked in hospitals in Wuhan, and 522 (41.5%) were frontline health care workers. A considerable proportion of participants reported symptoms of depression (634 [50.4%]), anxiety (560 [44.6%]), insomnia (427 [34.0%]), and distress (899 [71.5%]). Nurses, women, frontline health care workers, and those working in Wuhan, China, reported more severe degrees of all measurements of mental health symptoms than other health care workers (eg, median [IQR] Patient Health Questionnaire scores among physicians vs nurses: 4.0 [1.0-7.0] vs 5.0 [2.0-8.0]; P = .007; median [interquartile range {IQR}] Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale scores among men vs women: 2.0 [0-6.0] vs 4.0 [1.0-7.0]; P < .001; median [IQR] Insomnia Severity Index scores among frontline vs second-line workers: 6.0 [2.0-11.0] vs 4.0 [1.0-8.0]; P < .001; median [IQR] Impact of Event Scale–Revised scores among those in Wuhan vs those in Hubei outside Wuhan and those outside Hubei: 21.0 [8.5-34.5] vs 18.0 [6.0-28.0] in Hubei outside Wuhan and 15.0 [4.0-26.0] outside Hubei; P < .001). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed participants from outside Hubei province were associated with lower risk of experiencing symptoms of distress compared with those in Wuhan (odds ratio [OR], 0.62; 95% CI, 0.43-0.88; P = .008). Frontline health care workers engaged in direct diagnosis, treatment, and care of patients with COVID-19 were associated with a higher risk of symptoms of depression (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.11-2.09; P = .01), anxiety (OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.22-2.02; P < .001), insomnia (OR, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.92-4.60; P < .001), and distress (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.25-2.04; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this survey of heath care workers in hospitals equipped with fever clinics or wards for patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan and other regions in China, participants reported experiencing psychological burden, especially nurses, women, those in Wuhan, and frontline health care workers directly engaged in the diagnosis, treatment, and care for patients with COVID-19.\\n\\nText: Abbreviation: PHQ-9, 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire; GAD-7, 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder; ISI, 7-item Insomnia Severity Index; IES-R, 22-item Impact of Event Abbreviation: IES-R, 22-item Impact of Event Scale-Revised; IQR, interquartile range.

Over the last 20 years, there has been a substantial decrease in the incidence of childhood pneumonia and pneumonia-associated mortality. New conjugate vaccines against Haemophilus influenzae type b and Streptococcus pneumoniae have contributed to decreases in radiologic, clinical and complicated pneumonia cases and have reduced hospitalization and mortality. The importance of co-infections with multiple pathogens and the predominance of viral-associated disease are emerging. Better access to effective preventative and management strategies is needed in low- and middle-income countries, while new strategies are needed to address the residual burden of disease once these have been implemented.\\n\\nText: Pneumonia has been the leading cause of death in children younger than 5 years for decades. Although there have been substantial decreases in overall child mortality and in pneumonia-specific mortality, pneumonia remains the major single cause of death in children outside the neonatal period, causing approximately 900,000 of the estimated 6.3 million child deaths in 2013 [1] . Substantial advances have occurred in the understanding of risk factors and etiology of pneumonia, in development of standardized case definitions, and in prevention with the production of improved vaccines and in treatment. Such advances have led to changes in the epidemiology, etiology and mortality from childhood pneumonia. However in many areas access to these interventions remains sub-optimal, with large inequities between and within countries and regions. In this paper we review the impact of recent preventative and management advances in pneumonia epidemiology, etiology, radiologic presentation and outcome in children.\\n\\nThe overall burden of childhood pneumonia has been reduced substantially over the last decade, despite an increase in the global childhood population from 605 million in 2000 to 664 million in 2015 [2] . Recent data suggest that there has been a 25% decrease in the incidence of pneumonia, from 0.29 episodes per child year in low-and middle-income countries in 2000, to 0.22 episodes per child year in 2010 [3] . This is substantiated by a 58% decrease in pneumonia-associated disability-adjusted life years between 1990 and 2013, from 186 million to 78 million as estimated in the Global Burden of Disease study [1] . Pneumonia deaths decreased from 1.8 million in 2000 to 900,000 in 2013 [1] . These data do not reflect the full impact of increasingly widespread use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in low-and middle-income countries because the incidence of pneumonia and number of deaths are likely to decrease still further as a result of this widespread intervention [4] .\\n\\nNotwithstanding this progress, there remains a disproportionate burden of disease in low-and middle-income countries, where more than 90% of pneumonia cases and deaths occur. The incidence in high-income countries is estimated at 0.015 episodes per child year, compared to 0.22 episodes per child year in low-and middle-income countries [3] . On average, 1 in 66 children in high-income countries is affected by pneumonia per year, compared to 1 in 5 children in low-and middle-income countries. Even within low-and middleincome countries there are regional inequities and challenges with access to health care services: up to 81% of severe pneumonia deaths occur outside a hospital [5] . In addition to a higher incidence of pneumonia, the case fatality rate is estimated to be almost 10-fold higher in low-and middle-income countries as compared to high-income countries [3, 5] .\\n\\nChildhood pneumonia can also lead to significant morbidity and chronic disease. Early life pneumonia can impair longterm lung health by decreasing lung function [6] . Severe or recurrent pneumonia can have a worse effect on lung function; increasing evidence suggests that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease might be related to early childhood pneumonia [7, 8] . A meta-analysis of the risk of long-term outcomes after childhood pneumonia categorized chronic respiratory sequelae into major (restrictive lung disease, obstructive lung disease, bronchiectasis) and minor (chronic bronchitis, asthma, abnormal pulmonary function) groups [9] . The risk of developing at least one of the major sequelae was estimated as 6% after an ambulatory pneumonia event and 14% after an episode of hospitalized pneumonia. Because respiratory diseases affect almost 1 billion people globally and are a major cause of mortality and morbidity [10] , childhood pneumonia might contribute to substantial morbidity across the life course.\\n\\nChest radiologic changes have been considered the gold standard for defining a pneumonia event [11] because clinical findings can be subjective and clinical definitions of pneumonia can be nonspecific. In 2005, to aid in defining outcomes of pneumococcal vaccine studies, the World Health Organization\\'s (WHO) standardized chest radiograph description defined a group of children who were considered most likely to have pneumococcal pneumonia [12] . The term \"end-point consolidation\" was described as a dense or fluffy opacity that occupies a portion or whole of a lobe, or the entire lung. \"Other infiltrate\" included linear and patchy densities, peribronchial thickening, minor patchy infiltrates that are not of sufficient magnitude to constitute primary end-point consolidation, and small areas of atelectasis that in children can be difficult to distinguish from consolidation. \"Primary end-point pneumonia\" included either end-point consolidation or a pleural effusion associated with a pulmonary parenchymal infiltrate (including \"other\" infiltrate).\\n\\nWidespread use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination and Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccination has decreased the incidence of radiologic pneumonia. In a review of four randomized controlled trials and two case-control studies of Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccination in high-burden communities, the vaccination was associated with an 18% decrease in radiologic pneumonia [13] . Introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination was associated with a 26% decrease in radiologic pneumonia in California between 1995 and 1998 [14] . In vaccine efficacy trials in low-and middle-income countries, pneumococcal conjugate vaccination reduced radiologic pneumonia by 37% in the Gambia [15] , 25% in South Africa [16] and 26% in the Philippines [17] .\\n\\nThe WHO radiologic case definition was not intended to distinguish bacterial from viral etiology but rather to define a sub-set of pneumonia cases in which pneumococcal infection was considered more likely and to provide a set of standardized definitions through which researchers could achieve broad agreement in reporting chest radiographs. However, despite widespread field utilization, there are concerns regarding inter-observer repeatability. There has been good consensus for the description of lobar consolidation but significant disagreement on the description of patchy and perihilar infiltrates [18, 19] . In addition, many children with clinically severe lung disease do not have primary end-point pneumonia: in one pre-pneumococcal conjugate vaccination study, only 34% of children hospitalized with pneumonia had primary end-point pneumonia [20] . A revised case definition of \"presumed bacterial pneumonia\" has been introduced, and this definition includes pneumonia cases with WHO-defined alveolar consolidation, as well as those with other abnormal chest radiograph infiltrates and a serum C-reactive protein of at least 40 mg/L [21, 22] . This definition has been shown to have greater sensitivity than the original WHO radiologic definition of primary end-point pneumonia for detecting the burden of pneumonia prevented by pneumococcal conjugate vaccination [23] . Using the revised definition, the 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-10), had a vaccine efficacy of 22% in preventing presumed bacterial pneumonia in young children in South America [22] , and pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-13 had a vaccine efficacy of 39% in preventing presumed bacterial pneumonia in children older than 16 weeks who were not infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in South Africa [21] . Thus there is convincing evidence that pneumococcal conjugate vaccination decreases the incidence of radiologic pneumonia; however there is no evidence to suggest that pneumococcal conjugate vaccination modifies the radiologic appearance of pneumococcal pneumonia.\\n\\nEmpyema is a rare complication of pneumonia. An increased incidence of empyema in children was noted in some high-income countries following pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7 introduction, and this was attributed to pneumococcal serotypes not included in pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7, especially 3 and 19A [24] . In the United States, evidence from a national hospital database suggests that the incidence of empyema increased 1.9-fold between 1996 and 2008 [25] . In Australia, the incidence rate ratio increased by 1.4 times when comparing the pre-pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7 period (1998 to 2004) to the post-pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7 period (2005 to 2010) [26] . In Scotland, incidence of empyema in children rose from 6.5 per million between 1981 and 1998, to 66 per million in 2005 [27] . These trends have been reversed since the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-13. Data from the United States suggest that empyema decreased by 50% in children younger than 5 years [28] ; similarly, data from the United Kingdom and Scotland showed substantial reduction in pediatric empyema following pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-13 introduction [29, 30] .\\n\\nSeveral national guidelines from high-income countries, as well as the WHO recommendations for low-and middleincome countries, recommend that chest radiography should not be routinely performed in children with ambulatory pneumonia [31] [32] [33] . Indications for chest radiography include hospitalization, severe hypoxemia or respiratory distress, failed initial antibiotic therapy, or suspicion for other diseases (tuberculosis, inhaled foreign body) or complications. However, point-of-care lung ultrasound is emerging as a promising modality for diagnosing childhood pneumonia [34] .\\n\\nIn addition to the effect on radiologic pneumonia, pneumococcal conjugate vaccination reduces the risk of hospitalization from viral-associated pneumonia, probably by reducing bacterial-viral co-infections resulting in severe disease and hospitalization [35] . An analysis of ecological and observational studies of pneumonia incidence in different age groups soon after introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7 in Canada, Italy, Australia, Poland and the United States showed decreases in all-cause pneumonia hospitalizations ranging from 15% to 65% [36] . In the United States after pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-13 replaced pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7, there was a further 17% decrease in hospitalizations for pneumonia among children eligible for the vaccination, and a further 12% decrease among unvaccinated adults [28] .\\n\\nA systematic review of etiology studies prior to availability of new conjugate vaccines confirmed S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae type B as the most important bacterial causes of pneumonia, with Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae associated with some severe cases. Respiratory syncytial virus was the leading viral cause, identified in 15-40% of pneumonia cases, followed by influenza A and B, parainfluenza, human metapneumovirus and adenovirus [37] .\\n\\nMore recent meta-analyses of etiology data suggest a changing pathogen profile, with increasing recognition that clinical pneumonia is caused by the sequential or concurrent interaction of more than one organism. Severe disease in particular is often caused by multiple pathogens. With high coverage of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination and Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccination, viral pathogens increasingly predominate [38] . In recent case-control studies, at least one virus was detected in 87% of clinical pneumonia cases in South Africa [39] , while viruses were detected in 81% of radiologic pneumonia cases in Sweden [40] . In a large multi-center study in the United States, viral pathogens were detected in 73% of children hospitalized with radiologic pneumonia, while bacteria were detected in only 15% of cases [41] . A meta-analysis of 23 case-control studies of viral etiology in radiologically confirmed pneumonia in children, completed up to 2014, reported good evidence of causal attribution for respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, metapneumovirus and parainfluenza virus [42] . However there was no consistent evidence that many other commonly described viruses, including rhinovirus, adenovirus, bocavirus and coronavirus, were more commonly isolated from cases than from controls. Further attribution of bacterial etiology is difficult because it is often not possible to distinguish colonizing from pathogenic bacteria when they are isolated from nasal specimens [43] .\\n\\nAnother etiology is pertussis. In the last decade there has also been a resurgence in pertussis cases, especially in highincome countries [44] . Because pertussis immunity after acellular pertussis vaccination is less long-lasting than immunity after wild-type infection or whole-cell vaccination, many women of child-bearing age have waning pertussis antibody levels. Their infants might therefore be born with low transplacental anti-pertussis immunoglobulin G levels, making them susceptible to pertussis infection before completion of the primary vaccination series [45] . In 2014, more than 40,000 pertussis cases were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States; in some states, population-based incidence rates are higher than at any time in the last 70 years [44] . In contrast, most low-and middleincome countries use whole-cell pertussis vaccines and the numbers of pertussis cases in those countries were stable or decreasing until 2015 [46] . However recent evidence from South Africa (where the acellular vaccine is used) shows an appreciable incidence of pertussis among infants presenting with acute pneumonia: 2% of clinical pneumonia cases among infants enrolled in a birth cohort were caused by pertussis [39] , and 3.7% of infants and young children presenting to a tertiary academic hospital had evidence of pertussis infection [47] .\\n\\nSimilarly, childhood tuberculosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in many low-and middle-income countries, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis has increasingly been recognized as a pathogen in acute pneumonia in children living in high tuberculosis-prevalence settings. Postmortem studies of children dying from acute respiratory illness have commonly reported M. tuberculosis [48, 49] . A recent systematic review of tuberculosis as a comorbidity of childhood pneumonia reported culture-confirmed disease in about 8% of cases [50] . Because intrathoracic tuberculosis disease is only culture-confirmed in a minority of cases, the true burden could be even higher; tuberculosis could therefore be an important contributor to childhood pneumonia incidence and mortality in high-prevalence areas.\\n\\nChildhood pneumonia and clinically severe disease result from a complex interaction of host and environmental risk factors [37] . Because of the effectiveness of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination and Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccination for prevention of radiologic and clinical pneumonia, incomplete or inadequate vaccination must be considered as a major preventable risk factor for childhood pneumonia. Other risk factors include low birth weight, which is associated with 3.2 times increased odds of severe pneumonia in low-and middle-income countries, and 1.8 times increased odds in high-income countries [51] . Similarly, lack of exclusive breastfeeding for the first 4 months of life increases odds of severe pneumonia by 2.7 times in low-and middle-income countries and 1.3 times in highincome countries. Markers of undernutrition are strong risk factors for pneumonia in low-and middle-income countries only, with highly significant odds ratios for underweight for age (4.5), stunting (2.6) and wasting (2.8) . Household crowding has uniform risk, with odds ratios between 1.9 and 2.3 in both low-and middle-income countries and high-income countries. Indoor air pollution from use of solid or biomass fuels increases odds of pneumonia by 1.6 times; lack of measles vaccination by the end of the first year of age increases odds of pneumonia by 1.8 times [51] . It is estimated that the prevalence of these critical risk factors in low-and middle-income countries decreased by 25% between 2000 and 2010, contributing to reductions in pneumonia incidence and mortality in low-and middle-income countries, even in countries where conjugate vaccines have not been available [3] .\\n\\nThe single strongest risk factor for pneumonia is HIV infection, which is especially prevalent in children in sub-Saharan Africa. HIV-infected children have 6 times increased odds of developing severe pneumonia or of death compared to HIV-uninfected children [52] . Since the effective prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV, there is a growing population of HIV-exposed children who are uninfected; their excess risk of pneumonia, compared to HIV unexposed children, has been described as 1.3-to 3.4-fold higher [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] .\\n\\nThe pneumococcal conjugate vaccination and Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccination have been effective tools to decrease pneumonia incidence, severity and mortality [58, 59] . However, equitable coverage and access to vaccines remains sub-optimal. By the end of 2015, Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccination had been introduced in 73 countries, with global coverage estimated at 68%. However, inequities are still apparent among regions: in the Americas coverage is estimated at 90%, while in the Western Pacific it is only 25%. By 2015, pneumococcal conjugate vaccination had been introduced into 54 countries, with global coverage of 35% for three doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination for infant populations [60] . To address this issue, the WHO\\'s Global Vaccine Access Plan initiative was launched to make life-saving vaccines more equitably available. In addition to securing guarantees for financing of vaccines, the program objectives include building political will in low-and middle-income countries to commit to immunization as a priority, social marketing to individuals and communities, strengthening health systems and promoting relevant local research and development innovations [61] .\\n\\nMaternal vaccination to prevent disease in the youngest infants has been shown to be effective for tetanus, influenza and pertussis [62] . Influenza vaccination during pregnancy is safe, provides reasonable maternal protection against influenza, and also protects infants for a limited period from confirmed influenza infection (vaccine efficacy 63% in Bangladesh [63] and 50.4% in South Africa [64] ). However as antibody levels drop sharply after birth, infant protection does not persist much beyond 8 weeks [65] . Recently respiratory syncytial virus vaccination in pregnancy has been shown to be safe and immunogenic, and a phase-3 clinical trial of efficacy at preventing respiratory syncytial virus disease in infants is under way [66] . Within a decade, respiratory syncytial virus in infancy might be vaccine-preventable, with further decreases in pneumonia incidence, morbidity and mortality [67] .\\n\\nImproved access to health care, better nutrition and improved living conditions might contribute to further decreases in childhood pneumonia burden. The WHO Integrated Global Action Plan for diarrhea and pneumonia highlights many opportunities to protect, prevent and treat children [68] . Breastfeeding rates can be improved by programs that combine education and counseling interventions in homes, communities and health facilities, and by promotion of baby-friendly hospitals [69] . Improved home ventilation, cleaner cooking fuels and reduction in exposure to cigarette smoke are essential interventions to reduce the incidence and severity of pneumonia [70, 71] . Prevention of pediatric HIV is possible by providing interventions to prevent mother-to-child transmission [72] . Early infant HIV testing and early initiation of antiretroviral therapy and cotrimoxazole prophylaxis can substantially reduce the incidence of community-acquired pneumonia among HIV-infected children [73] . Community-based interventions reduce pneumonia mortality and have the indirect effect of improved-careseeking behavior [58] . If these cost-effective interventions were scaled up, it is estimated that 67% of pneumonia deaths in lowand middle-income countries could be prevented by 2025 [58] .\\n\\nCase management of pneumonia is a strategy by which severity of disease is classified as severe or non-severe. All children receive early, appropriate oral antibiotics, and severe cases are referred for parenteral antibiotics. When implemented in highburden areas before the availability of conjugate vaccines, case management as part of Integrated Management of Childhood Illness was associated with a 27% decrease in overall child mortality, and 42% decrease in pneumonia-specific mortality [74] . However the predominance of viral causes of pneumonia and low case fatality have prompted concern about overuse of antibiotics. Several randomized controlled trials comparing oral antibiotics to placebo for non-severe pneumonia have been performed [75] [76] [77] and others are ongoing [78] . In two studies, performed in Denmark and in India, outcomes of antibiotic and placebo treatments were equivalent [76, 77] . In the third study, in Pakistan, there was a non-significant 24% vs. 20% rate of failure in the placebo group, which was deemed to be non-equivalent to the antibiotic group [75] . Furthermore, because WHO-classified non-severe pneumonia and bronchiolitis might be considered within a spectrum of lower respiratory disease, many children with clinical pneumonia could actually have viral bronchiolitis, for which antibiotics are not beneficial [79] . This has been reflected in British [33] and Spanish [31] national pneumonia guidelines, which do not recommend routine antibiotic treatment for children younger than 2 years with evidence of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination who present with non-severe pneumonia. The United States\\' national guidelines recommend withholding antibiotics in children up to age 5 years presenting with non-severe pneumonia [32] . However, given the high mortality from pneumonia in low-and middle-income countries, the lack of easy access to care, and the high prevalence of risk factors for severe disease, revised World Health Organization pneumonia guidelines still recommend antibiotic treatment for all children who meet the WHO pneumonia case definitions [80] .\\n\\nUse of supplemental oxygen is life-saving, but this is not universally available in low-and middle-income countries; it is estimated that use of supplemental oxygen systems could reduce mortality of children with hypoxic pneumonia by 20% [81] . Identifying systems capacity to increase availability of oxygen in health facilities, and identifying barriers to further implementation are among the top 15 priorities for future childhood pneumonia research [82] . However, up to 81% of pneumonia deaths in 2010 occurred outside health facilities [5] , so there are major challenges with access to health services and health-seeking behavior of vulnerable populations. Identifying and changing the barriers to accessing health care is an important area with the potential to impact the survival and health of the most vulnerable children [82] .\\n\\nMuch progress has been made in decreasing deaths caused by childhood pneumonia. Improved socioeconomic status and vaccinations, primarily the conjugate vaccines (against Haemophilus influenzae and pneumococcus), have led to substantial reductions in the incidence and severity of childhood pneumonia. Stronger strategies to prevent and manage HIV have reduced HIV-associated pneumonia deaths. However, despite the substantial changes in incidence, etiology and radiology globally, there remain inequities in access to care and availability of effective interventions, especially in low-and middle-income countries. Effective interventions need to be more widely available and new interventions developed for the residual burden of childhood pneumonia.'}}>,\n",

No approved drug is available for the specific treatment of JEV infections, and the available vaccines are not effective against all clinical JEV isolates. In the study described here, a high-throughput screening of an FDA-approved drug library for inhibitors of JEV was performed. Five hit drugs that inhibited JEV infection with a selective index of >10 were identified. The antiviral activities of these five hit drugs against other flavivirus, including Zika virus, were also validated. As three of the five hit drugs were calcium inhibitors, additional types of calcium inhibitors that confirmed that calcium is essential for JEV infection, most likely during viral replication, were utilized. Adaptive mutant analysis uncovered that replacement of Q130, located in transmembrane domain 3 of the nonstructural NS4B protein, which is relatively conserved in flaviviruses, with R or K conferred JEV resistance to manidipine, a voltage-gated Ca(2+) channel (VGCC) inhibitor, without an apparent loss of the viral growth profile. Furthermore, manidipine was indicated to protect mice against JEV-induced lethality by decreasing the viral load in the brain, while it abrogated the histopathological changes associated with JEV infection. This study provides five antiflavivirus candidates and identifies cytoplasmic calcium to be a novel antiviral target for the treatment of JEV infection. The findings reported here provide therapeutic possibilities for combating infections caused by flaviviruses. IMPORTANCE No approved therapy for the treatment of Japanese encephalitis virus infection is currently available. Repurposing of approved drugs would accelerate the development of a therapeutic stratagem. In this study, we screened a library of FDA-approved drugs and identified five hit drugs, especially calcium inhibitors, exerting antiflavivirus activity that blocked viral replication. The in vivo efficacy and toxicity of manidipine were investigated with a mouse model of JEV infection, and the viral target was identified by generating an adaptive mutant.\\n\\nText: F laviviruses are taxonomically classified in the genus Flavivirus and family Flaviviridae.\\n\\nThese viruses comprise over 70 different pathogens, such as Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), Zika virus (ZIKV), dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), and yellow fever virus (YFV). Most flaviviruses are arthropod borne and cause public health problems worldwide (1) . The development and usage of vaccines against some flaviviruses, such as JEV, YFV, and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), have decreased the rates of morbidity and mortality from infections caused by these viruses (2) ; however, flavivirus-induced diseases are still pandemic, and few therapies beyond intensive supportive care are currently available.\\n\\nFlaviviruses have an approximately 11-kb positive-stranded RNA genome containing a single open reading frame (ORF) flanked by untranslated regions (UTRs) at both termini. The ORF encodes three structural proteins, including the capsid (C), membrane (premembrane [prM] and membrane [M] ), and envelope (E), and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) (3) . These seven nonstructural proteins participate in viral replication, virion assembly, and virus escape from immune surveillance.\\n\\nTo date, no specific antivirals with activity against flaviviruses are available. To address this, we conducted a screen of a library of 1,018 FDA-approved drugs. Since flaviviruses are similar in structure and pathogenesis, we first utilized JEV as the prototype to screen the drug library and subsequently validated the antiviral activities with ZIKV, WNV, and DENV type 2 (DENV-2). The hit drugs identified in this study offer potential new therapies for the treatment of flavivirus infection and disease.\\n\\nScreening of an FDA-approved drug library for inhibitors of JEV infection. Recombinant viral particles (RVPs) with the luciferase-reporting replicon enveloped by the JEV structural proteins were used to select inhibitors, with a focus on those that inhibit virus entry and replication, by a high-throughput screening (HTS) assay (4, 5) . The number of genomic RNA copies of RVP was determined to be 8.4 ϫ 10 6 copies/ml by using a standard curve generated with plasmids carrying the infectious clone. The HTS assay conditions, including the seeding cell density and RVP dose, were optimized to be 10,000 cells per 96-well plate and 20 l (16 copies/cell) RVP for the infective dose, respectively. Under the optimized conditions, the signal-to-basal (S/B) ratio, coefficient of variation (CV), and Z= factor were 38,374, 2.8%, and 0.89, respectively, which demonstrated that the assay was robust and suitable for the large-scale screening of compounds.\\n\\nA schematic of the HTS assay is depicted in Fig. 1B . After three rounds of screening, five hits with a selective index (SI; which is equal to the 50% cytotoxic concentration [CC 50 [/50% inhibitory concentration [IC 50 ]) of Ͼ10 were selected. The CC 50 values of the hit drugs exhibited in Fig. 1B were similar to those previously published for diverse cell systems but determined using different toxicity assays (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) . Three of the hit drugs, manidipine, cilnidipine, and benidipine hydrochloride, were dihydropyridine (DHP) voltage-gated Ca 2ϩ channel (VGCC) antagonists, while pimecrolimus is an inhibitor of inflammatory cytokine secretion and nelfinavir mesylate is an HIV-1 protease blocker. All five drugs exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of JEV RVP infection (Fig. 1C) . To validate the antiviral effect, hit drugs were purchased from other commercial sources and tested. In the reconfirmation screen, all hit drugs showed antiviral and cytotoxic effects similar to those found in the primary screen.\\n\\nValidation of hit drugs. To verify the results obtained by the luciferase reporter assays, we also investigated the antiviral effect of the five hit drugs on wild-type JEV strain AT31. As expected from the HTS assay, all five drugs robustly inhibited virus production, with a reduction of approximately 4 to 5 log units at the highest concentration and an approximately 1-log-unit decrease with 2.5 M the drugs (Fig. 2B) . A sharp decrease in JEV RNA levels was also detected (Fig. 2C) . The attenuated RNA levels in the high-dose, middle-dose, and low-dose groups were all above 40%. In particular, in the manidipine-treated group, the inhibitory effect was at least 80% compared to that for the control, which showed a strong inhibition of viral replication. Consistent with the inhibition of virus replication and production, expression of the viral structural protein prM was hardly detectable following treatment with the drugs at the high concentration (Fig. 2D) . Overall, the results in Fig. 2 confirmed that the five hit drugs inhibited JEV infection in a dose-dependent manner in vitro.\\n\\nDrugs inhibit JEV infection during viral RNA synthesis. Because RVPs, which have a natural virus-like envelope on the outside and a replicon on the inside, permitted the quantification of JEV productive entry and replication, a time-of-addition experiment was performed to investigate whether the hit drugs blocked the entry step or the replication step. As shown in Fig. 3B , no suppression of luciferase activity by any of the hit drugs was observed when they were used as treatments before infection or during infection or as a virucide, suggesting that these drugs do not inhibit JEV infection either by inactivating the virus directly or by blocking JEV entry. However, these drugs exerted fully inhibitory effects when they were added at 1 h postinfection, suggesting that viral replication was the stage at which these drugs showed inhibitory activity.\\n\\nTo confirm this suggestion, we investigated the inhibitory effects of these drugs on the JEV replicon. The highest concentration of manidipine and nelfinavir mesylate tested in baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells was adjusted to 5 M and 10 M, respectively. It was shown that all five drugs inhibited JEV RNA synthesis in a dosedependent manner, while neither drug inhibited the initial translation of replicon RNA (5, 14) (Fig. 3C) , confirming that these drugs inhibited JEV infection at the stage of replication.\\n\\nHit drugs exhibit broad-spectrum antiflavivirus activity. In order to determine whether the antiviral activity of the five hit drugs extended to other flaviviruses, we explored their antiviral effect against ZIKV. Similar to the findings for JEV, the ZIKV titer was decreased by multiple log units when ZIKV was treated with a high concentration of each of the drugs (Fig. 4A) . Moreover, ZIKV exhibited a higher sensitivity to the two calcium channels inhibitors manidipine and cilnidipine than JEV, with no plaque formation being observed at 10 M. Consistent with this result, sharp decreases in the level of replication of ZIKV RNA and the level of expression of viral protein were also detected (Fig. 4A) . Notably, treatment with 5 M manidipine produced a 95% inhibition of viral replication, translation, and viral yields. Taken together, these results indicate that the hit drugs could effectively inhibit ZIKV infection.\\n\\nSince these drugs exhibited their anti-JEV effects at the stage of viral replication, we further tested the effects against WNV and DENV-2 by using WNV and DENV-2 replicons. Similar to the results for JEV, a dose-dependent reduction in the level of WNV replication was observed with the drug treatments. The same phenotype was observed for DENV-2 for all drugs except nelfinavir mesylate, which showed no effect at the concentrations tested ( Fig. 4B and C). Together, these results indicate that the five hit drugs are excellent candidates for broad-spectrum antiflavivirus treatment. Antiviral effect of calcium inhibitors. Since three hit drugs, manidipine, cilnidipine, and benidipine hydrochloride, were DHP VGCC inhibitors, we asked whether other calcium antagonists could block JEV infection. To address this question, we employed four different classes of inhibitors. Verapamil, a prototype phenylalkylamine (PAA) VGCC inhibitor (15) , exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of JEV on both African Green monkey kidney (Vero) and human hepatocellular carcinoma (Huh-7) cells (Fig. 5) , which was consistent with the inhibitory effects of the DHP inhibitors, suggesting that calcium channels play an important role in JEV infection. Cyclosporine and 2-aminobiphenyl borate (2-APB), which inhibit the efflux of Ca 2ϩ from the mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) pool, respectively (16) (17) (18) (19) , were also found to block JEV infection effectively. Similarly, treatment with the cell-permeant Ca 2ϩ chelator 1,2-bis-(o-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N=,N=-tetraacetic acid, tetraacetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA-AM), could also suppress JEV infection. Taken together, we concluded that intracellular Ca 2ϩ is essential for JEV infection and cytoplasmic calcium is a potent target for antiflavivirus treatment.\\n\\nSelection and characterization of manidipine-resistant JEV. To identify the viral target of the calcium channel inhibitor, we selected a manidipine-resistant virus by serially passaging JEV in the presence of manidipine. Viruses from passage 20 (P20) showed robust resistance compared with the wild type (WT) (Fig. 6A ). When JEV from P20 was treated with 5 M or 10 M manidipine, the viral titer was about 10-and 100-fold higher than that of the WT, respectively. Individual virus clones were isolated, and two isolates were randomly selected and amplified. An amino acid substitution was observed in two isolated clones, resulting in a glutamine (Q)-to-arginine (R) switch at amino acid position 130 in transmembrane domain 3 (TMD3) of NS4B, i.e., position 2401 of the translated polyprotein in the JEV infectious cDNA clone (Fig. 6B ). Sequence alignment of NS4B indicated that Q130 was conserved in all flaviviruses except YFV, which possessed a lysine at that position (Fig.  6B) . The conserved Q130 of NS4B may account for the sensitivity of JEV, ZIKV, WNV, and DENV-2 to manidipine, as described above (Fig. 4) , while YFV showed resistance to the drug (data not shown).\\n\\nTo confirm that the Q130R mutation did confer manidipine resistance and to investigate the role of Q130 in NS4B function, we produced JEV clones with the Q130R, Q130K, Q130E, or Q130A mutation by introducing the desired mutations into the infectious cDNA clone and rescuing the mutant viruses. To investigate the biological properties of the mutant viruses, we first examined the growth kinetics of the rescued viruses. As shown in Fig. 6C , all mutant viruses had an accumulation of infectious virions and reached the highest titer at 60 h postinfection. Infection of the Q130R and Q130K mutant viruses resulted in growth curves similar to the growth curve for the WT (Fig.  6C) , while the Q130E and Q130A mutants produced smaller amounts of viruses between 24 and 60 h. Analysis of the plaque morphology revealed that the plaques of the Q130R, Q130K, and Q130E mutants were similar to the plaques of the WT, whereas the plaques of the Q130A mutant were smaller than those of the WT.\\n\\nWe next investigated the sensitivity of the four mutant viruses to manidipine. As shown in Fig. 6D , the Q130R and Q130K mutant viruses were resistant to manidipine. At a 10 M concentration, manidipine efficiently inhibited WT JEV infection and reduced the viral yields by approximately 4 log units, while the Q130R and Q130K mutant viruses were resistant to manidipine and the viral titer decreased less than 2 log units. The Q130A mutant virus demonstrated moderate resistance and a slightly higher Taken together, it could be concluded that Q130 not only is critical for conferring manidipine sensitivity but also is important for JEV replication. The replacement of glutamine with basic amino acids conferred resistance to manidipine without an apparent loss of growth.\\n\\nIn vivo efficacy of manidipine. As manidipine exhibited the strongest inhibitory activities on JEV replication as well as ZIKV infection when its activities were compared with those of the five hit drugs (Fig. 2 and 4A) , we further examined the protective effect of manidipine against JEV-induced lethality in a mouse model. As anticipated, mice in the JEV-infected vehicle-treated group started to show symptoms, including limb paralysis, restriction of movement, piloerection, body stiffening, and whole-body tremor, from day 5 postinfection. Within 21 days postinfection, most mice in the JEV-infected group succumbed to the infection, with the mortality rate being 73% (4 out of 15 animals survived). Manidipine treatment following JEV infection reduced the mortality rate to 20% (12 out of 15 animals survived) (Fig. 7A ). Mice treated with manidipine alone or treated with manidipine and infected with JEV showed little abnormal behavior, similar to the findings for the mice in the vehicle-treated group. These results suggest that manidipine provided effective protection against JEVinduced mortality.\\n\\nTo further relate these protective effects to the viral load and histopathological changes in the mouse brains, the viral titer was determined and mouse brain sections were collected and assayed at day 5 and day 21 postinfection, since mice started to show symptoms of JEV infection from day 5 postinfection and most of the surviving mice had recovered at day 21. The results indicated that, during the progression of the disease, manidipine treatment significantly reduced the viral load in infected mice compared to that in infected mice not receiving treatment, while no plaques formed in either the manidipine-or vehicle-treated group, and viral loads were undetectable in each group on day 21 postinfection (Fig. 7B) . As JEV was rapidly cleared from the blood after inoculation and was present in the lymphatic system during the preclinical phase, the effects of manidipine on infection of serum and the spleen were evaluated at earlier time points to detect whether the drug reduced the peripheral viral loads (20, 21) . As shown in Fig. 7C , manidipine had little effect on peripheral JEV infection, which indicated that manidipine protected the mice against JEV-induced lethality by decreasing the viral load in the brain. Similarly, apparent damage in the brain, including meningitis, perivascular cuffing, vacuolar degeneration, and glial nodules, was observed in the JEV-infected and vehicle-treated group on day 5 postinfection, while manidipine treatment remarkably alleviated these phenomena (Fig. 7D) . These results indicate that the alleviation of histopathological changes was accompanied by a reduction in the viral load as well as a reduction in the rate of mortality, further confirming the curative effects of manidipine on viral encephalitis.\\n\\nAmong the five hit drugs, manidipine, cilnidipine, and benidipine hydrochloride were VGCC inhibitors. It has been well documented in the literature that Ca 2ϩ inhibitors serve to inhibit virus infection at the stage of either entry (15, 22) or replication (18) and even at the stage of budding (23) . To this end, we first reviewed all 21 calcium inhibitors included in the current library of FDA-approved drugs and found that, in addition to the four DHP VGCC inhibitors listed in Fig. 1B , two other calcium inhibitors, i.e., flunarizine dihydrochloride and lomerizine hydrochloride, were also identified to be primary candidates with levels of inhibition of Ͼ90%. Similarly, three calcium channel antagonists, nisoldipine, felodipine, and nicardipine hydrochloride, showed levels of inhibition of 75%, 72%, and 66%, respectively, in the primary screen. Together, 9 of the 21 calcium inhibitors in the library, accounting for nearly half of the calcium inhibitors, exhibited levels of flavivirus inhibition of greater than 50%, suggesting that calcium, especially the calcium channel, is a potential antiviral target. To address this, another type of VGCC inhibitor, verapamil, an FDA-approved drug not yet included in the drug library used in this study, was investigated. Likewise, a Ca 2ϩ chelator, BAPTA-AM, as well as the Ca 2ϩ inhibitors 2-APB and cyclosporine, targeting ER and the mitochondrial Ca 2ϩ channel, respectively, were employed to investigate the response of JEV infection to the decrease in intracellular Ca 2ϩ levels. In line with the activities of the three hit DHP VGCC inhibitor drugs, the additional Ca 2ϩ inhibitors exerted anti-JEV activity, which indicated that Ca 2ϩ is indispensable for JEV infection. Thus, Ca 2ϩ inhibitors might be utilized as effective treatments for flavivirus infection.\\n\\nAs the hit drugs exerted full inhibitory activity when they were added posttreatment, we believe that Ca 2ϩ is important for flavivirus genome replication. Furthermore, selection and genetic analysis of drug-resistant viruses revealed that NS4B is the viral target of manidipine. NS4B is part of the viral replication complex and is supposed to anchor the viral replicase to the ER membrane (24) . Meanwhile, the N-terminal 125amino-acid domain of DENV NS4B was indicated to be responsible for inhibition of the immune response (25) . Notably, several structurally distinct compounds have been identified to inhibit flavivirus replication by intensively targeting the TMD of NS4B (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) . It is thus conceivable that inhibitors targeting TMD of NS4B would perturb its function, leading to the suppression of viral RNA replication. In this study, the replacement of Q130 of NS4B with a basic amino acid conferred the resistance effect without suppressing JEV replication, suggesting that position 130 could tolerate a basic amino acid and that the basic amino acid might be involved in the interplay of NS4B with host proteins rather than viral proteins.\\n\\nMoreover, the efficacy and toxicity of manidipine were monitored in vivo, with manidipine demonstrating effective antiviral activity with favorable biocompatibility. However, the dose used in this study was higher than the dose typically used clinically, representing one of the scenarios most commonly encountered in drug repurposing (33, 34) . As manidipine was approved for use for the long-term treatment of hypertension (35, 36) , pulse-dose treatment with manidipine over the shorter period of time required for the treatment of virus infection might be relatively safe. Moreover, use of a combination of manidipine with other Ca 2ϩ inhibitors might improve its therapeutic efficacy, reduce its toxicity, and reduce the risk of resistance development (37) (38) (39) .\\n\\nBesides the three VGCC inhibitors, two hit drugs, pimecrolimus and nelfinavir mesylate, showed equivalent inhibitory activities on the replication of JEV, ZIKV, WNV, and DENV-2. Although there has been no report on the use of pimecrolimus for the treatment of infectious diseases, we showed that it had a robust effect against JEV with an SI of Ͼ32. The maximum plasma concentration (C max ) of nelfinavir mesylate achieved with an adult dose was 3 to 4 g/ml (40) , which was comparable to the IC 50 reported here. Notably, nelfinavir mesylate was confirmed to inhibit herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and the replication of several other herpesviruses by interfering directly or indirectly with the later steps of virus formation, such as glycoprotein maturation or virion release, other than functioning in herpesviruses protease (41, 42) . Whether nelfinavir mesylate inhibits flavivirus by interference with the virus protease or by other off-target effects is unknown. Understanding of the mechanism of the antiflavivirus effects of these drugs might uncover novel targets of the drugs, providing further insight into the pathogenesis of flaviviruses.\\n\\nAbove all, the findings reported here provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying flavivirus infection and offer new and promising therapeutic possibilities for combating infections caused by flaviviruses.\\n\\nCells and viruses. BHK-21, SH-SY5Y (human neuroblastoma), Vero, and Huh-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (HyClone, Logan, UT, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA). JEV strain AT31, the WNV replicon, and the DENV-2 replicon expressing Renilla luciferase (Rluc) were kindly provided by Bo Zhang, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), China. JEV replicon recombinant viral particles (RVPs) were generated as previously described (4, 5) . ZIKV strain H/PF/2013, kindly provided by the European Virus Archive Goes Global, was propagated and titrated in Vero cells.\\n\\nOptimization of HTS assay conditions. The cell density and RVP dose were optimized for the HTS assay. Vero cells at different densities (2,500 to 12,500 cells per well) were infected with from 1.25 to 20 l RVPs (1 to 16 copies per well). The appropriate cell density as well as the RVP dose was selected by comparing the S/B ratio, CV, and Z= values under different conditions as previously described (43) . Methyl-␤-cyclodextrin and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were used as positive and negative controls, respectively.\\n\\nHTS assay of an FDA-approved compound library. A library of 1,018 FDA-approved drugs was purchased from Selleck Chemicals (Houston, TX, USA). The compounds were stored as 10 mM stock solutions in DMSO at 4°C until use. The first round of the HTS assay was carried out as shown in Fig. 1A . The criteria used to identify the primary candidates were no apparent cytotoxicity and an average level of inhibition of Ͼ90% in duplicate wells. The criteria of dose-dependent inhibition and cell viability of Ͼ80% were applied for the reconfirmation screen. Furthermore, the CC 50 of each compound was calculated, and those compounds displaying SIs over 10 were considered hits in this study.\\n\\nIdentification of antiviral effects of five hit drugs. The antiviral effects of the drugs were evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR), immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and plaque assay as previously reported (44) (45) (46) (47) . The experimental timeline is depicted in Fig. 2A .\\n\\nTo ensure the effectiveness of the hit drugs in flavivirus replication, BHK-21 cells transfected with the JEV, WNV, or DENV-2 replicon were incubated with each drug at the concentrations indicated above, and the luciferase activities were determined 24 h, 48 h, or 72 h later, respectively.\\n\\nTime-of-addition experiment. To evaluate which stage of the JEV life cycle was inhibited by each hit, a time-of-addition experiment was performed as previously described (43) . Vero cells were infected with 20 l RVPs for 1 h (0 to 1 h). The test compounds were incubated with the cells for 1 h before infection (Ϫ1 to 0 h), during infection (0 to 1 h), and for 23 h postinfection (1 to 24 h) (Fig. 3A) . To exclude a possible direct inactivating effect of the drugs, RVPs were incubated with each drug at 37°C for 1 h, and the mixtures were diluted 25-fold to infect Vero cells. Twenty-four hours later, the luciferase activities were determined as described above (Fig. 3A) .\\n\\nManidipine-resistant virus. Manidipine-resistant virus was generated by passaging of JEV on Vero cells in the presence of manidipine. Passages 1 to 10 used 5 M manidipine, and passages 11 to 20 used 10 M manidipine. As a control, WT virus was passaged in the presence of 2% DMSO in parallel. Passaging was terminated at passage 20, when no further improvement in resistance was detected. Two manidipine-resistant virus isolates were plaque purified and amplified in the presence of manidipine. Viral RNA was extracted, amplified, and purified for sequencing. An infectious cDNA clone of JEV, strain AT31 (pMWJEAT), kindly provided by T. Wakita, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute for Neuroscience, was used to recover WT and mutant viruses as described previously (4) . Virus titers and manidipine sensitivities were determined by plaque assay in Vero cells.\\n\\nManidipine administration to JEV-infected mice. Adult female BALB/c mice (age, 4 weeks) were kept in the Laboratory Animal Center of Wuhan Institute of Virology, CAS (Wuhan, China). The mice were randomly divided into four groups (30 mice per group): a JEV-infected and vehicle (2% Tween 80 plus 5% DMSO in phosphate-buffered saline [PBS])-treated group, a manidipine-treated group, a JEV-infected and manidipine-treated group, and a vehicle-treated group. For infection, mice were infected intraperitoneally with 5 ϫ 10 6 PFU of JEV strain AT31. For the manidipine and vehicle treatments, mice were injected intraperitoneally with 25 mg/kg of body weight manidipine or PBS with 2% Tween 80 and 5% DMSO, respectively. Treatments were administered twice a day for the first 2 days and then consecutively administered once a day for up to 21 days. Five mice from each group were sacrificed on days 1, 3, and 5 postinfection. Serum, spleen tissue, and brain tissue samples were collected for viral titer determination and histopathology investigation. Fifteen mice were monitored daily for morbidity and mortality. The mice that showed neurological signs of disease were euthanized according to the Regulations for the Administration of Affairs Concerning Experimental Animals in China. The protocols were reviewed and approved by the Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, CAS (Wuhan, China).'}}>,\n",

Although apparently disadvantaged by their dependence on the host biosynthetic processes, an immensely faster rate of evolution provides viruses with an edge in this conflict. In this review, I have discussed the potential anti-virus activity of inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), a well characterized effector of the cellular homeostatic response to an overloading of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein-folding capacity. IRE1, an ER-membrane-resident ribonuclease (RNase), upon activation catalyses regulated cleavage of select protein-coding and non-coding host RNAs, using an RNase domain which is homologous to that of the known anti-viral effector RNaseL. The latter operates as part of the Oligoadenylate synthetase OAS/RNaseL system of anti-viral defense mechanism. Protein-coding RNA substrates are differentially treated by the IRE1 RNase to either augment, through cytoplasmic splicing of an intron in the Xbp1 transcript, or suppress gene expression. This referred suppression of gene expression is mediated through degradative cleavage of a select cohort of cellular RNA transcripts, initiating the regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD) pathway. The review first discusses the anti-viral mechanism of the OAS/RNaseL system and evasion tactics employed by different viruses. This is followed by a review of the RIDD pathway and its potential effect on the stability of viral RNAs. I conclude with a comparison of the enzymatic activity of the two RNases followed by deliberations on the physiological consequences of their activation.\\n\\nText: Establishment of infection by a virus, even in permissive host cells, is beset with a plethora of challenges from innate-antiviral and cell-death pathways. Therefore, the host response to a virus infection might prove to be inhibitory for the viral life cycle in a direct or an indirect manner. The direct mechanism involves expression of multiple anti-viral genes that have evolved to recognize, react, and thereby rid the infected host of the viral nucleic acid (Zhou et al., 1997; Thompson et al., 2011) . On the other hand the pathways, e.g., those that culminate in initiating an apoptotic death for the host cell, indirectly serve to limit the spread of virus (Roulston et al., 1999) . A major difference between these two mechanisms is that while the former response is transmissible to neighboring uninfected cells through interferon (IFN) signaling, the latter is observed mostly in cis. Recent reports, however, have demonstrated transmission of an apoptotic signal between cells that are in contact through gap junctions, although such a signaling from an virus infected host cell to an uninfected one is not known yet (Cusato et al., 2003; Udawatte and Ripps, 2005; Kameritsch et al., 2013) . Successful viral pathogens, through a process of active selection, have evolved to replicate and simultaneously evade or block either of these host responses. The viral nucleic acids which could be the genome (positive-sense singlestranded RNA virus) or RNA derived from transcription of the genome [negative-stranded single-sense RNA or double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) or DNA virus], offer critical targets for both detection and eradication. The viral nucleic acid targeting armaments in the host arsenal include those that recognize the associated molecular patterns like toll-like receptors (TLRs), DDX58 (or RIG-1), IFIH1 (or MDA5), IFIT proteins [IFN-stimulated genes (ISG)56 and ISF54], etc. (Aoshi et al., 2011; Bowzard et al., 2011; Jensen and Thomsen, 2012) . This is followed by IFN signaling and expression or activation of factors that target the inducer for degradation or modification like OAS/ribonuclease L (RNaseL) system, APOBEC3, MCPIP1, the ZC3HAV1/exosome system and RNAi pathways (Gao et al., 2002; Sheehy et al., 2002; Guo et al., 2007; Daffis et al., 2010; Sidahmed and Wilkie, 2010; Schmidt et al., 2012; Cho et al., 2013a; Lin et al., 2013) . In this review we focus on two proteins containing homologous RNase domains, RNaseL with a known direct antiviral function and Inositolrequiring enzyme 1 (IRE1 or ERN1) which has an RNaseL-like RNase domain with a known role in homeostatic response to unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and a potential to function as an antiviral (Figure 1 ; Tirasophon et al., 2000) .\\n\\nIn mammalian cells the tell-tale signs of RNA virus infection, like the presence of cytosolic RNA having 5 -ppp or extensive (>30 bp) dsRNA segments are detected by dedicated pathogen associated molecular pattern receptors (PAMPs) or pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in the host cell, like RIG-1, MDA5, and the IFIT family of proteins (Aoshi et al., 2011; Bowzard et al., 2011; Vabret and Blander, 2013) . The transduction of a signal of this recognition results in the expression of IFN genes the products www.frontiersin.org FIGURE 1 | Schematic representation of the ribonuclease activity of IRE1 and RNaseL showing cross-talk between the paths catalysed by the enzymes. The figure shows activation of RNase activity following dimerization triggered by either accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER-lumen or synthesis of 2-5A by the enzyme OAS, respectively, for IRE1 and RNaseL. The cleavage of Xbp1u by IRE1 releases an intron thus generating Xbp1s. The IRE1 targets in RIDD pathway or all RNaseL substrates are shown to undergo degradative cleavage. The cleavage products generated through degradation of the respective substrate is shown to potentially interact with RIG-I thereby leading to Interferon secretion and trans-activation of Oas genes through Interferon signaling. Abbreviations: RIG-I = retinoic acid inducible gene-I, Ifnb = interferon beta gene loci, IFN = interferons, ISG = interferon-sensitive genes, 2-5A = 2 -5 oligoadenylates.\\n\\nof which upon secretion outside the cell bind to cognate receptors, initiating further downstream signaling (Figure 1 ; Randall and Goodbourn, 2008) . The genes that are regulated as a result of IFN signaling are termed as IFN-stimulated or IFN-regulated genes (ISGs or IRGs; Sen and Sarkar, 2007; Schoggins and Rice, 2011) . Oligoadenylate synthetase or OAS genes are canonical ISGs that convert ATP into 2 -5 linked oligoadenylates (2-5A) by an unique enzymatic mechanism (Figure 1 ; Hartmann et al., 2003) . Further, they are RNA-binding proteins that function like PRRs, in a way that the 2-5A synthesizing activity needs to be induced through an interaction with dsRNA (Minks et al., 1979; Hartmann et al., 2003) . In a host cell infected by an RNA virus, such dsRNA is present in the form of replication-intermediates (RI), which are synthesized by the virus-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) and subsequently used by the same enzyme to synthesize more genomic RNA, through asymmetric transcription (Weber et al., 2006) . However, the replications complexes (RCs) harboring these RI molecules are found secluded inside host-membrane derived vesicles, at least in positive-strand RNA viruses, a group which contains many human pathogens (Uchil and Satchidanandam, 2003; Denison, 2008) . Reports from different groups suggest OAS proteins to be distributed both in the cytoplasm as well as in membrane-associated fractions, perhaps indicating an evolution of the host anti-viral methodologies towards detection of the membrane-associated viral dsRNAs (Marie et al., 1990; Lin et al., 2009) . DNA viruses on the other hand, produce dsRNA by annealing of RNA derived from transcription of both strands in the same viral genomic loci, which are probably detected by the cytoplasmic pool of OAS proteins (Jacobs and Langland, 1996; Weber et al., 2006) . Post-activation the OAS enzymes synthesize 2-5A molecules in a non-processive reaction producing oligomers which, although potentially ranging in size from dimeric to multimeric, are functionally active only in a trimeric or tetrameric form (Dong et al., 1994; Sarkar et al., 1999; Silverman, 2007) . These small ligands, which bear phosphate groups (1-3) at the 5 end and hydroxyl groups at the 2 and 3 positions, serve as co-factor which can specifically interact with and thereby allosterically activate, existing RNaseL molecules (Knight et al., 1980; Zhou et al., 1997 Zhou et al., , 2005 Sarkar et al., 1999) . As part of a physiological control system these 2-5A oligomers are quite unstable in that they are highly susceptible to degradation by cellular 5 -phosphatases and PDE12 (2 -phosphodiesterase; Silverman et al., 1981; Johnston and Hearl, 1987; Kubota et al., 2004; Schmidt et al., 2012) . Viral strategies to evade or overcome this host defense mechanism ranges from preventing IFN signaling which would hinder the induction of OAS expression or thwarting activation of expressed OAS proteins by either shielding the viral dsRNA from interacting with it or modulating the host pathway to synthesize inactive 2-5A derivatives (Cayley et al., 1984; Hersh et al., 1984; Rice et al., 1985; Maitra et al., 1994; Beattie et al., 1995; Rivas et al., 1998; Child et al., 2004; Min and Krug, 2006; Sanchez and Mohr, 2007; Sorgeloos et al., 2013) . Shielding of viral RNA from interacting with OAS is possible through enclosure of dsRNA replication intermediates in membrane enclosed compartments as observed in many flaviviruses (Ahlquist, 2006; Miller and Krijnse-Locker, 2008; Miorin et al., 2013) .\\n\\nRNaseL is a 741 amino acid protein containing three predominantly structured region, an N-terminal ankyrin repeat domain (ARD), a middle catalytically inactive pseudo-kinase (PK) and a C-terminal RNase domain (Figure 2A ; Hassel et al., 1993; Zhou et al., 1993) . The activity of the RNase domain is negatively regulated by the ARD, which is relieved upon binding of 2-5A molecules to ankyrin repeats 2 and 4 followed by a conformational alteration (Figure 1 ; Hassel et al., 1993; Tanaka et al., 2004; Nakanishi et al., 2005) . In support of this contention, deletion of the ARD has been demonstrated to produce constitutively active RNaseL, although with dramatically lower RNase activity (Dong and Silverman, 1997) . However, recent reports suggest that while 2-5A links the ankyrin repeats from adjacent molecules leading to formation of dimer and higher order structures, at sufficiently high in vitro concentrations, RNaseL could oligomerize even in the absence of 2-5A . Nonetheless, in vivo the RNaseL nuclease activity still seems to be under the sole regulation of 2-5A (Al-Saif and Khabar, 2012) . In order to exploit this dependence, multiple viruses like mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and rotavirus group A (RVA) have evolved to encode phosphodiesterases capable of hydrolysing the 2 -5 linkages in 2-5A and thereby attenuate the RNaseL cleavage activity (Zhao et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2013) . In addition to 5 -phosphatases and 2 -phosphodiesterases to reduce ClustalW alignment of primary sequence from a segment of the PK domain indicating amino acid residues which are important for interacting with nucleotide cofactors. The conserved lysine residues, critical for this interaction (K599 for IRE1 and K392 in RNaseL) are underlined. (C) Alignment of the KEN domains in RNaseL and IRE1. The amino acids highlighted and numbered in IRE1 are critical for the IRE1 RNase activity (Tirasophon et al., 2000) .\\n\\nthe endogenous 2-5A levels, mammalian genomes encode posttranscriptional and post-translation inhibitors of RNaseL activity in the form of microRNA-29 and the protein ABCE1 (RNaseL inhibitor or RLI), respectively (Bisbal et al., 1995; Lee et al., 2013) . Direct inhibition of RNaseL function is also observed upon infection by Picornaviruses through, either inducing the expression of ABCE1 or exercising a unique inhibitory property of a segment of the viral RNA (Martinand et al., 1998 (Martinand et al., , 1999 Townsend et al., 2008; Sorgeloos et al., 2013) .\\n\\nOnce activated by 2-5A, RNaseL can degrade single-stranded RNA irrespective of its origin (virus or host) although there seems to exist a bias towards cleavage of viral RNA (Wreschner et al., 1981a; Silverman et al., 1983; Li et al., 1998) . RNA sequences that are predominantly cleaved by RNaseL are U-rich with the cleavage points being typically at the 3 end of UA or UG or UU di-nucleotides, leaving a 5 -OH and a 3 -monophosphate in the cleavage product (Floyd-Smith et al., 1981; Wreschner et al., 1981b) . A recent report shows a more general consensus of 5 -UNN-3 with the cleavage point between the second and the third nucleotide (Han et al., 2014) . Cellular targets of RNaseL include both ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and mRNAs, the latter predominantly representing genes involved in protein biosynthesis (Wreschner et al., 1981a; Al-Ahmadi et al., 2009; Andersen et al., 2009) . Additionally, RNaseL activity can also degrade specific ISG mRNA transcripts and thereby attenuate the effect of IFN signaling (Li et al., 2000) . Probably an evolution towards insulating gene expression from RNaseL activity is observed in the coding region of mammalian genes where the UU/UA dinucleotide frequency is rarer (Bisbal et al., 2000; Khabar et al., 2003; Al-Saif and Khabar, 2012) . Perhaps not surprisingly, with a much faster rate of evolution, similar observations have been made with respect to evasion of RNaseL mediated degradation by viral RNAs too (Han and Barton, 2002; Washenberger et al., 2007) . Moreover, nucleoside modifications in host mRNAs, rarely observed in viral RNAs, have also been shown to confer protection from RNaseL (Anderson et al., 2011) . In addition to directly targeting viral RNA, the reduction in functional ribosomes and ribosomal protein mRNA affects viral protein synthesis and replication in an indirect manner. Probably, as a reflection of these effects on cellular RNAs, RNaseL is implicated as one of the factors determining the anti-proliferative effect of IFN activity . The anti-viral activity of RNaseL extends beyond direct cleavage of viral RNA, through stimulation of RIG-I by the cleavage product (Malathi et al., , 2007 (Malathi et al., , 2010 . A global effect of RNaseL is observed in the form of autophagy induced through c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling and apoptosis, probably as a consequence of rRNA cleavage (Li et al., 2004; Chakrabarti et al., 2012; Siddiqui and Malathi, 2012) . RNaseL has also been demonstrated to play a role in apoptotic cell death initiated by pharmacological agents extending the physiological role of this pathway beyond the boundary of being only an anti-viral mechanism (Castelli et al., 1997 (Castelli et al., , 1998 .\\n\\nThe ER serves as a conduit for maturation of cellular proteins which are either secreted or destined to be associated with a membrane for its function. An exclusive microenvironment (high Calcium ion and unique ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione) along with a battery of ER-lumen resident enzymes (foldases, chaperones, and lectins) catalyse/mediate the necessary folding, disulfide-bond formation, and glycosylation reactions (Schroder and Kaufman, 2005) . A perturbation of the folding capacity, due to either physiological disturbances or virus infection, can lead to an accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER lumen, which signals an unfolded protein response (UPR). UPR encompasses a networked transcriptional and translational gene-expression program, initiated by three ER-membrane resident sensors namely IRE1 or ERN1, PKR-like ER Kinase (PERK or EIF2AK3) and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6; Hetz, 2012) . IRE1 is a type I single-pass trans-membrane protein in which, similar to what is observed with RNaseL, the N-terminal resident in the ER lumen serves as sensor and the cytosolic C-terminal as the effector (Figure 1 ; Chen and Brandizzi, 2013) . The IRE1 coding gene is present in genomes ranging from yeast to mammals and in the latter is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues (Tirasophon et al., 1998) . Signal transduction by stimulated IRE1 initiates multiple gene regulatory pathways with either pro-survival or pro-apoptotic consequences (Kaufman, 1999) . During homeostasis or unstressed conditions the sensor molecules are monomeric, a state maintained co-operatively by the \" absence\" of unfolded proteins and the \"presence\" of HSPA5 (GRP78 or Bip, an ERresident chaperone) molecules bound to a membrane-proximal disordered segment of the protein in the ER-lumen-resident Nterminus (Credle et al., 2005) . Accumulated unfolded proteins in the lumen triggers coupling of this domain from adjacent sensor molecules through a combination of (a) titration of the bound HSPA5 chaperone molecules and (b) direct tethering by malfolded protein molecules (Shamu and Walter, 1996; Credle et al., 2005; Aragon et al., 2009; Korennykh et al., 2009) . Abutting of the luminal domains juxtapose the cytosolic C-terminal segments, leading to an aggregation of the IRE1 molecules into distinct ER-membrane foci (Kimata et al., 2007; Li et al., 2010) . The C-terminal segment has a serine/threonine kinase domain and a RNase domain homologous to that of RNaseL (Figure 1 ; Tirasophon et al., 1998 Tirasophon et al., , 2000 . A trans-autophosphorylation by the kinase domain allosterically activates the RNase domain (Tirasophon et al., 2000; Lee et al., 2008; Korennykh et al., 2009) . In fact, exogenous over-expression of IRE1 in mammalian cells lead to activation suggesting that, under homeostatic conditions, the non-juxtaposition of cytosolic domains maintains an inactive IRE1 (Tirasophon et al., 1998) . Once activated, IRE1 performs cleavage of a variety of RNA substrates mediated by its RNase domain, in addition to phosphorylating and thereby activating JNK (Cox and Walter, 1996; Urano et al., 2000) . Depending on the RNA substrate, the cleavage catalyzed by IRE1 RNase produces differential consequence. Although scission of the Xbp1 mRNA transcript at two internal positions is followed by splicing of the internal segment through ligation of the terminal cleavage products, that in all other known IRE1 target RNA is followed by degradation (Figure 1 ; Sidrauski and Walter, 1997; Calfon et al., 2002) . The latter mode of negative regulation of gene expression is termed as the regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD) pathway (Hollien and Weissman, 2006; Oikawa et al., 2007; Iqbal et al., 2008; Lipson et al., 2008) . Gene transcripts regulated by RIDD pathway includes that from IRE1 (i.e., selftranscripts), probably in a negative feedback loop mechanism (Tirasophon et al., 2000) . In addition to protein coding RNA, RIDD pathway down-regulates the level of a host of microRNA precursors (pre-miRNAs) and can potentially cleave in the anticodon loop of tRNA Phe (Korennykh et al., 2011; Upton et al., 2012) .\\n\\nThe IRE1 RNase domain cleaves the Xbp1u (u for unspliced) mRNA transcript at two precise internal positions within the open reading frame (ORF) generating three segments, the terminal two of which are ligated by a tRNA ligase in yeast and by an unknown ligase in mammalian cells, to produce the Xbp1s (s for spliced) mRNA transcript (Figure 1 ; Yoshida et al., 2001) . The Xbp1s thus generated has a longer ORF, which is created by a frame-shift in the coding sequence downstream of the splice site (Cox and Walter, 1996; Calfon et al., 2002) . A similar dual endonucleolytic cleavage is also observed to initiate the XRN1 and Ski2-3-8 dependent degradation of transcripts in the RIDD degradation pathway (Hollien and Weissman, 2006) . The RIDD target transcript genes are predominantly those that encode membrane-associated or secretory proteins and which are not necessary for ER proteinfolding reactions (Hollien and Weissman, 2006) . The cleavage of Xbp1 and the RIDD-target transcripts constitute homeostatic or pro-survival response by IRE1 since XBP1S trans-activates genes encoding multiple chaperones (to fold unfolded proteins) and the ERAD pathway genes (to degrade terminally misfolded proteins) whereas RIDD reduces flux of polypeptides entering the ER lumen (Lee et al., 2003; Hollien and Weissman, 2006) . On the other hand, cleavage of pre-miRNA transcripts which are processed in the cell to generate CASPASE-2 mRNA (Casp2) controlling miRNAs, constitutes the pro-apoptotic function of IRE1 (Upton et al., 2012) . Another pro-apoptotic signal from IRE1 emanates from signaling through phosphorylation of JNK1 (Urano et al., 2000) . Although in the initial phase RIDD activity does not cleave mRNAs encoding essential ER proteins, at later stages of chronic UPR such transcripts are rendered susceptible to degradation promoting apoptosis induction (Han et al., 2009; Bhattacharyya et al., 2014) .\\n\\nInfection of mammalian cells by a multitude of viruses induce an UPR which is sometimes characterized by suppression of signaling by one or more of the three sensor(s; Su et al., 2002; Tardif et al., 2002; He, 2006; Yu et al., 2006 Yu et al., , 2013 Medigeshi et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2010; Merquiol et al., 2011) . Among these at least two viruses from diverse families, HCMV (a DNA virus) and hepatitis C virus (a hepacivirus), interfere with IRE1 signaling by different mechanism (Tardif et al., 2004; Stahl et al., 2013 ). An observed inhibition of any cellular function by a virus infection could suggest a potential anti-virus function for it, which the virus has evolved to evade through blocking some critical step(s). In both the cases mentioned above, stability of the viral proteins seems to be affected by ERAD-mediated degradation, although other potential anti-viral effect of IRE1 activation are not clear yet (Isler et al., 2005; Saeed et al., 2011) . Interestingly, host mRNA fragments produced following IRE1 activation during bacterial infection, has been shown to activate RIG-I signaling (Figure 1 ; Cho et al., 2013b) . Theoretically, other functions of IRE1 can also have anti-viral effect necessitating its inhibition for uninhibited viral replication. It is, however, still not clear whether IRE1 is able to cleave any viral RNA (or mRNA) in a manner similar to that of other RIDD targets (Figure 1) . The possibilities of such a direct anti-viral function are encouraged by the fact that all these viruses encode at least one protein which, as part of its maturation process, requires glycosylation and disulfide-bond formation. Such a necessity would entail translation of the mRNA encoding such a protein, which in case of positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses would mean the genome, in association with the ER-membrane (Figure 1 ; Lerner et al., 2003) . Additionally for many RNA viruses, replication complexes are housed in ER-derived vesicular structures (Denison, 2008; den Boon et al., 2010) . Considering the proximity of IRE1 and these virus-derived RNAs it is tempting to speculate that probably at some point of time in the viral life cycle one or more virus-associated RNA would be susceptible to cleavage by IRE1. However, studies with at least two viruses have shown that instead of increasing viral titre, inhibiting the RNase activity of activated IRE1 has an opposite effect (Hassan et al., 2012; Bhattacharyya et al., 2014) . This implies potential benefits of IRE1 activation through one or more of the following, (a) expression of chaperones or other pro-viral molecules downstream of XBP1Supregulation or JNK-activation, (b) cleavage of potential anti-viral gene mRNA transcripts by RIDD activity. However, the mode of protection for the viral RNA from RIDD activity is still not clear. It is possible that the viral proteins create a subdomain within the ER membrane, which through some mechanism excludes IRE1 from diffusing near the genomic RNA, thereby protecting the replication complexes (Denison, 2008) . It is therefore probably not surprising that single-stranded plus-sense RNA viruses encode a polyprotein, which produces replication complexes in cis, promoting formation of such subdomains (Egger et al., 2000) . The fact that IRE1 forms bulky oligomers of higher order probably aggravates such an exclusion of the activated sensor molecules from vicinity of the viral replication complexes. The UPR signaling eventually attenuate during chronic ER-stress and since that is what a virus-induced UPR mimics, probably the viral RNA needs protection only during the initial phase of UPR activation (Lin et al., 2007) . Since the choice of RIDD target seems to be grossly driven towards mRNAs that encode ER-transitory but are not ER-essential proteins, it is also possible that one or more viral protein have evolved to mimic a host protein the transcript of which is RIDD-resistant (Hollien and Weissman, 2006) . Most of the RIDD target mRNA are observed to be ER-membrane associated, the proximity to IRE1 facilitating association and cleavage (Figure 1 ; Hollien and Weissman, 2006) . Although ER-association for an mRNA is possible without the mediation of ribosomes, Gaddam and co-workers reported that continued association with polysomes for a membrane-bound mRNA can confer protection from IRE1 cleavage (Cui et al., 2012; Gaddam et al., 2013) . This would suggest important implications for the observed refractory nature of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and influenza virus RNA to RIDD cleavage (Hassan et al., 2012; Bhattacharyya et al., 2014) . In contrast to Influenza virus, flaviviruses (which include JEV) do not suppress host protein synthesis implying the absence of a global inhibition on translation as would be expected during UPR (Clyde et al., 2006; Edgil et al., 2006) . Therefore, a continued translation of viral RNA in spite of UPR activation can in principle confer protection from the pattern of RNA cleavage observed in the RIDD pathway.\\n\\nIRE1 and RNaseL, in addition to biochemical similarities in protein kinase domain and structural similarities in their RNase domain, share the functional consequences of their activation in initiating cellular apoptosis through JNK signaling (Table 1 and Figure 2 ; Liu and Lin, 2005; Dhanasekaran and Reddy, 2008) . Though initial discoveries were made in the context of homeostatic and anti-viral role for the former and latter, differences between the pathways are narrowed by further advances in research. In the same vein, while inhibition of IRE1 signaling in virus infected cells indicates a potential anti-viral role, www.frontiersin.org (Tirasophon et al., 1998; Dong and Silverman, 1999; Papa et al., 2003; Lin et al., 2007) Nature of RNase substrates Both 28S rRNA and mRNAs IRE1β can cleave both 28S rRNA and mRNA while IRE1α substrates include only mRNAs (Iwawaki et al., 2001) Dissimilarities\\n\\nCleavage substrates Beside 28S rRNA, predominantly cleaves mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins (Andersen et al., 2009) Xbp1u and other mRNAs in addition to microRNA precursors which are targeted as part of the RIDD pathway Selection of cleavage site Cleaved between 2nd and 3rd nucleotide positions of UN/N sites (Han et al., 2014) RNA sequence with the consensus of 5 -CUGCAG-3 in association with a stem-loop (SL) structure essential for recognition of Xbp1u and other mRNAs (Oikawa et al., 2010) association of RNaseL mutations with generation of prostate cancer extends the ambit of influence of this anti-viral effector to more non-infectious physiological disorders (Silverman, 2003) . Biochemically, the similarity in their RNase domains does not extend to the choice of either substrates or cleavage point, which are downstream of UU or UA in RNaseL and downstream of G (predominantly) for IRE1 ( Figure 2C ; Yoshida et al., 2001; Hollien and Weissman, 2006; Upton et al., 2012) . Further, while RNaseL cleaves pre-dominantly in single-stranded region, IRE1 seems to cleave equally well in single-and double-stranded region (Upton et al., 2012) . However, a recent report suggested a consensus cleavage site with the sequence UN/N, in RNaseL targets and in those mRNAs that are cleaved by IRE1 as part of the RIDD pathway (Han et al., 2014) . Access to potential cleavage substrate for RNaseL is conjectured to be facilitated through its association with polyribosomes, while no such association is known for IRE1 (Salehzada et al., 1991) . Possibilities exist that IRE1 would have preferential distribution in the rough ER which, upon activation, would give it ready access to mRNAs for initiating the RIDD pathway.\\n\\nIn the context of a virus infection, the pathway leading from both these proteins have the potential to lead to cell death. Notwithstanding the fact that this might be an efficient way of virus clearance, it also portends pathological outcomes for the infected organism. Future research would probably lead to design of drugs targeting these proteins based on the structural homology of their effector domains, regulating the pathological denouement of their activation without compromising their anti-viral or potential anti-viral functions.'}}>,\n",

In this study, microRNA, mRNA and cytokine/chemokine secretion profiling were investigated for human monocyte-derived macrophages infected in-vitro with Influenza virus A/H1N1 and/or Streptococcus pneumoniae. We observed that the in-vitro co-infection synergistically increased interferon-γ-induced protein-10 (CXCL10, IP-10) expression compared to the singly-infected cells conditions. We demonstrated that endogenous miRNA-200a-3p, whose expression was synergistically induced following co-infection, indirectly regulates CXCL10 expression by targeting suppressor of cytokine signaling-6 (SOCS-6), a well-known regulator of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Additionally, in a subsequent clinical pilot study, immunomodulators levels were evaluated in samples from 74 children (≤5 years-old) hospitalized with viral and/or bacterial community-acquired pneumonia. Clinically, among the 74 cases of pneumonia, patients with identified mixed-detection had significantly higher (3.6-fold) serum IP-10 levels than those with a single detection (P = 0.03), and were significantly associated with severe pneumonia (P < 0.01). This study demonstrates that viral and bacterial co-infection modulates the JAK-STAT signaling pathway and leads to exacerbated IP-10 expression, which could play a major role in the pathogenesis of pneumonia.\\n\\nText: Scientific RepoRts | 6:38532 | DOI: 10 .1038/srep38532 pathogenesis of several diseases and has been suggested as a potential biomarker of viral infection 10, 11 , late-onset bacterial infection in premature infants 12 , and a promising biomarker of sepsis and septic shock 13, 14 . Combined analysis of IP-10 and IFN-γ has also been reported as a useful biomarker for diagnosis and monitoring therapeutic efficacy in patients with active tuberculosis [15] [16] [17] , and both remain detectable in the urine of patients with pulmonary diseases in the absence of renal dysfunction 18 .\\n\\nWith airway epithelial cells 19 , resident alveolar macrophages (AMs) and blood monocytes-derived macrophages (recruited into tissues under inflammatory conditions 20, 21 ) represent a major line of defense against both pneumococcal (through their high phagocytic capacity [22] [23] [24] ) and influenza infection 25, 26 . So far, no studies have yet focused on the intracellular mechanisms that regulate IP-10 in human blood leukocytes during mixed IAV and SP infection. Several studies indicated that host non-coding small RNAs (including microRNAs) may function as immunomodulators by regulating several pivotal intracellular processes, such as the innate immune response 27 and antiviral activity 28, 29 ; both of these processes are closely related to toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways.\\n\\nIn this study, we firstly investigated the in vitro intracellular mechanisms that mediate the innate immune response in IAV and/or SP infected human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). Using this approach, we observed that mixed-infection of MDMs induces a synergistic production of IP-10 which can be related to a miRNA-200a/JAK-STAT/SOCS-6 regulatory pathway. Subsequently, in a retrospective analysis of clinical samples collected from children ≤ 5 years-old hospitalized with pneumonia, we confirmed that serum IP-10 level could be related to both viral and/or bacterial etiologies and disease severity.\\n\\nCharacteristics of MDMs infected by IAV and/or SP. Initially, we investigated in vitro the impact of single and mixed IAV and SP infection on MDMs. Firstly, active replication of IAV was assessed by qRT-PCR and quantification of new infectious viral particles in the cell supernatants ( Fig. 1a,b ). IAV titer increased over time after single infection with IAV and correlated with increased production of negative-strand IAV RNA. Maximum viral replication was observed at 18-24 hours post-infection, after which time both RNA replication and the quantity of infectious particles decreased. In this in vitro model, subsequent challenge of IAV-infected MDMs with SP had no significant impact on the production of new infectious viral particles (Fig. 1b) . Together, these results indicate permissive and productive infection of MDMs by IAV. Secondly, we evaluated whether MDMs are permissive for both IAV and SP infection. The presence of pneumococci within IAV-and SP-infected primary MDMs was confirmed at 8 h post-infection (Fig. 1c) , suggesting that MDMs are permissive for viral and bacterial co-infection in the early steps of infection. Importantly, confocal co-detection of mixed IAV and SP was only effective following 8 h post-infection due to the bactericidal impact of SP internalization within human macrophages (after 24 h, data not shown). Thirdly, we evaluated the impact of single and mixed infection with IAV and SP on MDM viability. Mixed infection significantly decreased cell viability (65.2 ± 4.5% total cell death at 48 hours post-infection; P < 0.0001) compared to single SP and IAV infection (39.6 ± 1.7% and 17.4 ± 1.1% total cell death, respectively; Fig. 1d ). Taken together, these results confirmed human MDMs are permissive to mixed viral and bacterial infection. mRNA, microRNA and protein expression profiling reveal an overall induction of the host innate immune response following IAV and/or SP infection of MDMs. To investigate the innate immune response orchestrated by IAV-and SP-infected human MDMs, we firstly evaluated the expression of 84 genes involved in the innate and adaptive immune responses (Table S1) ; the major differentially-expressed genes are summarized in Fig. 2a . Expression profiling indicated an overall induction of genes related to the JAK-STAT, NF-Κ β and TLR signaling pathways. Indeed, all interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) screened, including CXCL10 (fold-change [FC] = 240.9), CCL-2 (FC = 34.2) and MX-1 (FC = 151.4) were upregulated following mixed infection compared to uninfected cells, most of which are closely related to STAT-1 (FC = 52.3), IRF-7 (FC = 6.8) and IFNB1 (FC = 5.2) also found upregulated in mixed infected cells. Secondly, we investigated the endogenous microRNA expression profiles of IAV-and SP-infected MDMs. A selection of microRNAs that were found to be differentially-expressed under different infection conditions are shown in Fig. 2b and Table S2 . MiRNA-200a-3p was overexpressed after both single IAV (FC = 6.9), single SP (FC = 3.7) and mixed IAV/SP infection (FC = 7.3), indicating this miRNA may play a role in the innate immune response to viral and bacterial co-infection. Similar miRNA-200a-3p dysregulation profiles were obtained following IAV and/or SP infections of human macrophages-like (THP-1 monocytes-derived macrophages) or primary MDMs (data not shown). Thirdly, the secreted levels of various antiviral, pro-inflammatory and immunomodulatory cytokines/chemokines were assayed in IAV-and SP-infected-THP-1 and primary MDM cell supernatants. We observed a remarkable correlation between the mRNA and protein expression profiles of single or mixed infected MDMs especially regarding CXCL-10 and IP-10 expression. Indeed, the level of IP-10 was synergistically increased in the supernatant of IAV-infected THP-1 MDMs exposed to SP (mean: 30,589 ± 16,484 pg ml −1 ) compared to single IAV infection (1,439 ± 566.5 pg ml −1 ) and single SP infection (4,472 ± 2,001 pg ml −1 ; P≤ 0.05; Fig. 2c ) at 24 hours after infection. In those cells, IP-10 expression reduced over time (48 to 72 hours), coinciding with a significant higher proportion of necrotic and apoptotic cells (Fig. 1d) . The synergistic expression of IP-10 was similarly observed at 24 hours post-infection using primary MDMs (Fig. 2d) . Significantly increased secretion of the other tested cytokines and chemokines was not observed post-infection, even in mixed infected MDMs (Fig. S1 ). Interestingly, a significant production of IP-10 was also observed in supernatants of primary human airway epithelial cells (HAEC) mixed-infected by IAV and SP compared to the single infections (Fig. 2e) . Taken together, the mRNA and protein profiling results suggested that mixed viral and bacterial infection of MDMs induces a synergistic pro-inflammatory response related to the type-1 interferon and JAK-STAT signaling pathways, with IP-10 as signature of IAV/SP co-infection. Among all microRNAs screened, miR-200a-3p was the most Scientific RepoRts | 6:38532 | DOI: 10.1038/srep38532 overexpressed in IAV/SP co-infection of human MDMs. In the remainder of this study, we decided to investigate the interconnection between miR-200a-3p expression and the innate immune response.\\n\\nEndogenous miRNA-200a-3p expression correlates with CXCL10 (IP-10) induction following mixed IAV and SP infection of human MDMs. Using a specific Taqman probe assay targeting miR-200a-3p, we confirmed a significant upregulation of miR-200a-3p following mixed IAV and SP infection of human MDMs (Fig. 3a) . In this experiment, a more marked up-regulation of miR-200a-3p was observed following IAV+ SP compared to results obtained previously (Fig. 2b) . This discrepancy has been attributed to the use of two different approaches to quantify miR-200a-3p expression. The use of a target-specific stem-loop reverse transcription primer in Fig. 3a allows a better sensitivity of miR-200a-3p detection compared to the non-specific fluorescent dye used in Fig. 2b . As the general trend was suggestive of a synergistic induction of miR-200a-3p in response to mixed infection (Fig. 3a) , we hypothesized microRNA-200a-3p may play a role in the regulation of CXCL10 (IP-10), which was also synergistically upregulated in mixed-infected MDMs ( Fig. 2c and d) and primary HAEC ( Statistical analyses were performed using two-way ANOVA with Tukey\\'s post-hoc test; *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001.\\n\\nScientific RepoRts | 6:38532 | DOI: 10.1038/srep38532 CXCL10 (Fig. 3d) . These results suggested miR-200a-3p indirectly regulates CXCL10 and led us to hypothesize that miR-200a-3p controls a potential repressor of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. . At 18 h after transfection, the MDMs were singly or mixed infected as described previously. At 8 h post-IAV and/or SP infection, total mRNA was extracted and amplified by PCR using specific primers for the indicated genes. Values represent median ± IQR (a, c) or mean ± SEM (d, e) of three biological replicates. Statistical analyses were performed using a Kruskal-Wallis test (non-parametric, one-way ANOVA with Dunn\\'s post-hoc test) for data presented in (a, c). An ordinary two-way ANOVA (with Tukey\\'s post-hoc multiple comparison test) was used for data presented in (d, e). *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001. MiRNA-200a-3p indirectly regulates IP-10 expression by targeting SOCS6. As shown in Fig. 2a , several JAK-STAT signaling pathway genes were deregulated in mixed IAV-and SP-infected human MDMs; therefore, we hypothesized that miR-200a-3p directly regulates a regulator of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Predictive target analysis indicated that the 3\\' UTR of suppressor of cytokine signaling-6 (SOCS6) may be targeted by miR-200a-3p (Fig. 3b) . SOCS proteins constitute a class of negative regulators of JAK-STAT signaling pathways that are induced by both cytokines and TLR signaling. MiRNA-200a-3p was not predicted to target any of the other six members of the SOCS gene family. Transfection of human MDMs with MIM-200a downregulated SOCS6 (FC = 0.57) while inhibition of miR-200a-3p (INH-200a) upregulated SOCS6 (FC = 1.55), confirming that miR-200a-3p effectively regulates the expression of SOCS6 (Fig. 3e) . Moreover, SOCS6 was synergistically downregulated in IAV-or IAV/SP-infected MDMs overexpressing miRNA-200a (Fig. 3e) , suggesting that both infection and miR-200a-3p negatively regulate the expression of SOCS6. Finally, western blotting confirmed that expression of SOCS-6 sharply reduced following infection, especially after mixed IAV and SP infection (Fig. 3f) .\\n\\nThese results indicate miR-200a-3p is strongly induced in response to mixed viral and bacterial co-infection, which in turn leads to downregulation of the JAK-STAT regulator SOCS-6 at both the mRNA and protein levels and subsequent upregulation of IP-10.\\n\\nanalyses demonstrated mixed IAV and SP infection of human MDMs and HAEC induced significant production of IP-10. As blood leukocytes and respiratory tract epithelial cells actively contribute to inflammation during pneumonia, we hypothesized the level of IP-10 in serum of patient with pneumonia may be both indicative of mixed respiratory infection and disease severity. As part of a prospective, hospital-based, multicenter case-control study on the etiology of pneumonia among children under 5-years-old, a total of 74 patients (44 male, 30 female) were included in this pilot evaluation. According to WHO guidelines, retrospective analysis indicated 44 (59.5%) children had clinical signs of non-severe pneumonia and 30 (40.5%) children had signs of severe pneumonia. The main patient characteristics at inclusion are shown in Table 1 . Patients with severe pneumonia had significant more recorded episodes of dyspnea (P < 0.001), cyanosis (P = 0.03), lower chest indrawing (P < 0.001), dullness to percussion (P < 0.001) and lethargy (P < 0.001) during chest examination than patient with non-severe pneumonia. Moreover, pleural effusions were significantly more observed among critically ill patients and the duration of hospitalization was significantly longer for the children with severe pneumonia than for those with non-severe pneumonia (P = 0.0015). Two deaths occurred within the group of children retrospectively defined with severe pneumonia. Evaluation of the systemic inflammatory response of the 74 cases is shown in Table 2 . Serum level of CRP, IP-10, PCT, G-CSF, IL-6, IL-8 and MIP-1β were significantly more elevated in serum samples from critically ill patients. Patients with severe pneumonia had significantly higher (4.2-fold) serum IP-10 levels than those with a non-severe pneumonia (P < 0.001) suggesting IP-10 as a promising prognostic marker in pneumonia. Diagnostic accuracy measures for predicting pneumonia severity using blood-based biomarkers are summarized in Table S3 . Briefly, in this study, the optimal IP-10 cut-off value for identifying patient with severe pneumonia was 4,240 pg ml −1 , with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.69 (95% CI, 0.57 to 0.82, P < 0.001). Defining as positive a serum IP-10 level above this cut-off resulted in a sensitivity of 63.3%, specificity of 63.6% and a positive likelihood ratio of 1.74. Prognostic values of IP-10 were closed to procalcitonin (PCT; AUC = 0.70; 95% IC, 0.58 to 0.82, P < 0.001) and IL-6 (AUC = 0.70; 95% IC, 0.58-0.83, P < 0.001).\\n\\nMultiplex PCR-based screening of respiratory and blood samples reveal a high variety of pathogen associations (Table 3) . Respiratory viruses were detected in the nasal aspirates (NAs) of 63/74 patients (85.1%). Etiological bacteria of pneumonia (S. pneumoniae, n = 19; S. aureus, n = 1; or H. influenzae type B, n = 7) were identified via real-time PCR in the blood samples of 27/74 (36.5%) of the patients. Multiplex PCR assays allowed the identification of respiratory bacteria in the blood of 19 patients with negative blood culture results. Among the 74 cases PCR-positive for respiratory pathogens, a single virus or bacteria were detected in the NAs of 7 (9.4%) and 3 (4.0%) patients, respectively; these 10/74 (13.5%) cases were defined as the single infection group. The mixed infection group included the 62/74 (83.8%) cases in which (1) multiple viruses and/or bacteria were identified in NAs (38/74; 51.3%) without any bacteria identified in blood samples or (2) one or more viruses and/or bacteria were identified in NAs and associated with a blood bacteremia (24/74; 32.4%). We evaluated whether IP-10 serum level could correlate with the viral and bacterial etiologies of pneumonia. Patients with mixed infection had significant higher (3.6-fold) IP-10 serum level than patient with single detection (P = 0.03; Table 4 ). A stratified analysis reveals that the highest IP-10 serum level was observed among patients with both several respiratory pathogens identified (mixed-detection group) and severe pneumonia (14,427 pg ml −1 , IQR (3,981-82,994). In detail, a remarkable IP-10 serum level (142,531 pg ml −1 ), representing 33-fold higher above cut-off value predicting pneumonia severity was observed in patient with hRV in NA co-detected with S. pneumoniae (serotype 14) in pleural effusion and blood. In concordance with our in-vitro model of co-infection, a significant IP-10 level (90,338 pg ml −1 ) was quantified in blood sample of patient with severe bacteremic pneumococcal (serotype 14) pneumonia with a positive co-detection of Influenza B virus in NA. Taken together, these results suggest that high serum IP-10 levels are significantly associated with mixed viral and bacterial detection and also related to pneumonia pathogenesis.\\n\\nThis study provides additional in vitro and clinical data to improve our understanding of the immunopathology of mixed viral and bacterial pneumonia (Fig. 4) .\\n\\nThe in vitro model of influenza and pneumococcal superinfection of human MDMs demonstrated that mixed infection synergistically induced release of the pro-inflammatory chemokine IP-10, strongly suggesting human Scientific RepoRts | 6:38532 | DOI: 10.1038/srep38532 blood leukocytes contribute to the immunopathology of pneumonia. Additionally, transcriptomics and omics analyses provided new data on the inflammatory pathways that are activated during mixed infection and related to synergistic induction of the pro-inflammatory chemokine IP-10 in mixed infected cells. Our observations are consistent with a recent study describing IP-10 induction as host-proteome signature of both viral and bacterial infections 30 . Of the differentially-expressed genes observed in mixed infected MDMs, the transcription factors STAT-1 and IRF-7 appear to play crucial roles in the regulation of interferon-stimulated genes including CXCL10 (IP-10). By focusing on the intracellular mechanisms that regulate inflammatory pathways, we demonstrated a novel role for miRNA-200a-3p in the regulation of CXCL10 (IP-10). These observations are consistent with previous reports showing that RNA virus infection upregulates miR-155 in macrophages and dendritic cells and also regulates suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1), suggesting the existence of a miRNA/JAK-STAT/SOCS regulatory pathway during viral infection 29 . Our study suggests co-infection leads to overexpression of miR-200a-3p, which in turn targets and downregulates the JAK-STAT regulator SOCS-6 and consequently increases CXCL10 (IP-10) expression. Interestingly, a complementary in-silico approach reveals that several microRNAs that were found dysregulated in our experiments of IAV and SP co-infection of MDMs or HAEC, might target several genes of SOCS family and play similar role than miR-200a-3p. Indeed, miRNA-142-3p might target SOCS4, 5, 6 mRNA while miRNA-194-5p might target SOCS2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 mRNA. These observations underline that intra-cellular regulation of IP-10 is not limited to the contribution of a sole microRNA. A complex inter-relationship between numerous host microRNAs and inhibitors of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway occur to control host innate inflammatory response against viral and/or bacterial infections. Clinically, the majority of pediatric CAP cases in this study were associated with both positive viral and/or bacterial detection. Respiratory microorganisms were detected in 97% of cases; 51.3% of which were viral-viral, viral-bacterial or bacterial-bacterial co-detected only in nasal aspirates, 32.4% of which co-detected in both nasal aspirates and blood samples. These data are consistent with previous etiological studies of pediatric CAP 3,31-33 . S. pneumoniae was the major bacteria identified in blood (19/74; 25.7%) and mainly co-detected with respiratory viruses in NAs (16/19; 84.2%). We observed a very high diversity of viral and bacterial associations in biological samples from children with pneumonia. In comparison with IAV and SP14 combination evaluated in-vitro, no pneumonia cases were singly influenza and pneumococcus infected, and no similar co-detection with those two pathogens has been clinically observed. Nevertheless, Influenza B (IVB) virus was identified in 5 patients and two of them had a positive SP co-detection in blood (one non-typable strain and one serotype 14 using our molecular typing test). IVB and SP14 combination seems to be the nearest pathogen co-detection to that in-vitro investigated. Clinically, this co-detection was associated with both a very high IP-10 expression and a very severe pneumonia case definition. Interestingly, our translational pilot evaluation reveals IP-10 expression can be induced by several different viral and/or bacterial combinations. As immune response to each pathogen is different, further in-vitro investigations using different pathogens associations are needed to better characterize the mechanisms involved in the immunopathology of pneumonia.\\n\\nIn this cohort, highest serum IP-10 levels were identified among patients with both several pathogen detected and severe pneumonia, suggesting a significant role of IP-10 on pneumonia pathogenesis. Indeed, high plasma levels of IP-10 have previously been reported in patients with sepsis 12 , and were associated with high mortality rate, especially among patients with CAP 34 . Additionally, the IP-10-CXCR3 axis has been related to acute immune lung injury and lymphocyte apoptosis during the development of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 35, 36 . Moreover, an in vivo study that modeled influenza and pneumococcal superinfection in mice indicated that pro-inflammatory chemokines, including IP-10, play a crucial role in influenza-induced susceptibility to lung neutrophilia, severe immunopathology and mortality 37 . In this study, markedly elevated IP-10 (92,809 pg ml −1 ) combined with the highest PCT level (74.4 pg ml −1 ) were quantified in the serum sample of a child who died, in whom S. pneumoniae (serotype 9 V) was identified in the blood (PCR and blood culture) and co-detected with Haemophilus influenzae type B in nasal aspirate. These observations suggest an interrelationship between co-detection, elevated serum IP-10 and the pathogenesis of pneumonia.\\n\\nSeveral limitations of this pilot translational study need to be acknowledged before concluding mixed infection is related to elevated IP-10 and disease severity. Indeed, although viral shedding (e.g., of HRV and HBoV) is common in asymptomatic children, we were unable to evaluate the levels of immunomodulators in the serum samples of a control group. Moreover, although the samples were collected within the first 24 hours after admission, only a single blood sample was processed for each patient. Therefore, a larger, longitudinal study on the etiology and severity of pneumonia will be necessary to confirm these results. In conclusion, the present findings suggest that mixed respiratory infections and IP-10 may play major, interconnected roles in the pathogenesis of pneumonia. Clinically, assessment and monitoring of induced IP-10 serum level may assist clinicians to improve diagnosis and patient management of severe community-acquired pneumonia.\\n\\nViral and bacterial strains. The 10 ng ml −1 M-CSF (Miltenyi Biotec). THP− 1 MDMs were obtained by culturing cells with 10 ng ml -1 phorbol myristate acetate (PMA; Invivogen, Toulouse, France) for 72 hours. Human airway epithelial cells (HAEC, bronchial cell type) originated from a 54-years old woman with no pathology reported (batch number MD056501) were provided by Mucilair (Epithelix, Geneva, Switzerland). Sterility, tissue integrity (TEER), mucus production and cilia beating frequency have been certified by the company. Gene expression profiling. Total cellular mRNA was purified using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Reverse-transcription of total mRNA was performed using the RT 2 First Strand Kit (SABiosciences, Hilden, Germany). The expression of 84 genes involved in the human innate and adaptive immune responses was evaluated using the RT 2 profiler ™ PCR Array (SABiosciences) according to the manufacturer\\'s recommendations. The Δ Δ Ct method was applied to calculate the fold changes in gene expression for each gene relative to uninfected control cells using the web-based RT 2 profiler PCR Array Data Analysis software (SABiosciences).\\n\\nMicroRNA profiling array. Total cellular microRNAs were purified using the miRNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) and reverse-transcribed using the miScript Reverse Transcription kit (Qiagen). The profiling of 84 miRNAs was performed using the Human Immunopathology miScript miRNA PCR Array kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer\\'s instructions. Data were analyzed using the miScript miRNA PCR array data analysis web portal.\\n\\nIn silico miRNA target prediction. MiRNA target genes were retrieved and compiled using TargetScan 38 and microRNA.org resource 39 . The interactions between miRNAs and intracellular pathways were predicted using DIANA-miRPath v2.0 40 .\\n\\nTHP-1 MDMs were seeded in 24-well plates (0.5 × 10 6 per well) in triplicate, exposed to Influenza A H1N1 (A/Solomon islands/3/2006) virus (IAV) under serum-free conditions for 1 hour and then cultured for 3 hours in fresh RPMI-1640 containing 2% FBS. Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP) serotype 14 was added at 4 hours after IAV infection. Gentamicin (10 μ g ml −1 ) was added 2 hours after SP infection (i.e. 6 hours post-influenza infection) and maintained in the culture media throughout the experiment to kill extracellular bacteria and limit bacterial growth. Cell viability was determined by flow-cytometry using the FITC/Annexin V apoptosis detection kit (BD Biosciences), according to the manufacturer\\'s instructions. #4427975) . In this assay, fold changes have been defined by the Δ Δ Ct method using control RNU-44 and -48 as reference microRNAs. Total mRNA was purified from transfected and infected MDMs using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and specific primers were used to amplify transforming growth factor beta-2 (TGFB2; F: 5′ -CCATCCCGCCCACTTTCTAC-3′ , R: 5′ -AGCTCAATCCGTTGTTCAGGC-3′ ), SOCS6 (F: 5′ -AAGAATTCATCCCTTGGATTAGGTAAC-3′ , R: 5′ -CAGACTGGAGGTCGTGGAA-3′ ) 41 43 , and 3) absence of wheezing at auscultation, and, 4) first symptoms appearing within the last 14 days, and 5) radiological confirmation of pneumonia as per WHO guidelines 44 . Based on these primary criteria defining pneumonia cases, all 74 cases were retrospectively re-evaluated according to the WHO \"Pocket book of hospital care for children\" 45 criteria to evaluate pneumonia severity. Cases that died during the study, or who had at least one additional clinical signs including central cyanosis, dullness to percussion during chest examination, prostration/lethargy, pleural effusion observed on chest radiography were retrospectively included in the severe pneumonia group. Patients without any of these additional clinical signs were included in the non-severe pneumonia group. Table 4 . a IP-10 values are expressed in pg ml -1 . IP-10 concentration differences between groups were compared using unpaired Mann-Whitney tests; significant changes (P < 0.05) are in bold. Clinical and molecular analysis. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NAs) and whole blood samples were collected from children within 24 hours of admission. Whole blood samples were used for complete blood counts, blood culture and multiplex real-time PCR to identify Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type B 46 . S. pneumoniae serotypes were defined using a 11 multiplex real-time PCR assay targeting the 40 most frequently represented serotypes or serogroups according to protocol developed by Messaoudi et al. 47 . Serum C-reactive protein (CRP; AssayPro, St. Charles, Missouri, United States) and Procalcitonin (PCT; VIDAS B.R.A.H.M.S; bioMérieux) were quantified from whole-blood samples. Multiplex real-time non quantitative PCR (Fast-Track Diagnostic, Sliema, Malta) was used to detect 19 viruses and five bacteria in the respiratory specimens (NAs and pleural effusions). Mixed detection was defined as 1) PCR-positive for multiple viruses in NAs, 2) positive blood culture or PCR-positive for multiple bacteria in blood or 3) PCR-positive for one or multiple viruses in NAs and one or multiple bacteria in blood (identified by PCR and blood culture).\\n\\nEthical approval.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the magnitude of mental health outcomes and associated factors among health care workers treating patients exposed to COVID-19 in China. DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional, survey-based, region-stratified study collected demographic data and mental health measurements from 1257 health care workers in 34 hospitals from January 29, 2020, to February 3, 2020, in China. Health care workers in hospitals equipped with fever clinics or wards for patients with COVID-19 were eligible. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The degree of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress was assessed by the Chinese versions of the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, the 7-item Insomnia Severity Index, and the 22-item Impact of Event Scale–Revised, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with mental health outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 1257 of 1830 contacted individuals completed the survey, with a participation rate of 68.7%. A total of 813 (64.7%) were aged 26 to 40 years, and 964 (76.7%) were women. Of all participants, 764 (60.8%) were nurses, and 493 (39.2%) were physicians; 760 (60.5%) worked in hospitals in Wuhan, and 522 (41.5%) were frontline health care workers. A considerable proportion of participants reported symptoms of depression (634 [50.4%]), anxiety (560 [44.6%]), insomnia (427 [34.0%]), and distress (899 [71.5%]). Nurses, women, frontline health care workers, and those working in Wuhan, China, reported more severe degrees of all measurements of mental health symptoms than other health care workers (eg, median [IQR] Patient Health Questionnaire scores among physicians vs nurses: 4.0 [1.0-7.0] vs 5.0 [2.0-8.0]; P = .007; median [interquartile range {IQR}] Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale scores among men vs women: 2.0 [0-6.0] vs 4.0 [1.0-7.0]; P < .001; median [IQR] Insomnia Severity Index scores among frontline vs second-line workers: 6.0 [2.0-11.0] vs 4.0 [1.0-8.0]; P < .001; median [IQR] Impact of Event Scale–Revised scores among those in Wuhan vs those in Hubei outside Wuhan and those outside Hubei: 21.0 [8.5-34.5] vs 18.0 [6.0-28.0] in Hubei outside Wuhan and 15.0 [4.0-26.0] outside Hubei; P < .001). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed participants from outside Hubei province were associated with lower risk of experiencing symptoms of distress compared with those in Wuhan (odds ratio [OR], 0.62; 95% CI, 0.43-0.88; P = .008). Frontline health care workers engaged in direct diagnosis, treatment, and care of patients with COVID-19 were associated with a higher risk of symptoms of depression (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.11-2.09; P = .01), anxiety (OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.22-2.02; P < .001), insomnia (OR, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.92-4.60; P < .001), and distress (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.25-2.04; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this survey of heath care workers in hospitals equipped with fever clinics or wards for patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan and other regions in China, participants reported experiencing psychological burden, especially nurses, women, those in Wuhan, and frontline health care workers directly engaged in the diagnosis, treatment, and care for patients with COVID-19.\\n\\nText: Abbreviation: PHQ-9, 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire; GAD-7, 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder; ISI, 7-item Insomnia Severity Index; IES-R, 22-item Impact of Event Abbreviation: IES-R, 22-item Impact of Event Scale-Revised; IQR, interquartile range.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus was first recognized in September 2012 in Saudi Arabia. The clinical presentations of MERS and non-MERS SARI are often similar. Therefore, the identification of suspected cases that may have higher chances of being diagnosed as cases of MERS-CoV is essential. However, the real challenge is to flag these patients through some demographic markers. The nature of these markers has not previously been investigated in Saudi Arabia, and hence, this study aims to identify them. METHODS: It was a surveillance system-based study, for which data from a total of 23,646 suspected patients in Riyadh and Al Qassim regions were analyzed from January 2017 until December 2017 to estimate the prevalence of MERS-CoV among suspected cases and to determine potential demographic risk factors related to the confirmation of the diagnosis. RESULTS: Of 23,646 suspected cases, 119 (0.5%) were confirmed by laboratory results. These confirmed cases (67.2% of which were males) had a mean age of 43.23 years (SD ± 22.8). Around 42.2% of the confirmed cases were aged between 41 and 60 years and about 47% of confirmed cases had their suspected specimen tested in the summer. The study identified three significant and independent predictors for confirmation of the disease: an age between 41 and 60 years, male gender, and summer season admission. CONCLUSION: The study provides evidence that the MERS-CoV epidemic in the subject regions has specific characteristics that might help future plans for the prevention and management of such a contagious disease. Future studies should aim to confirm such findings in other regions of Saudi Arabia as well and explore potential preventable risk factors.\\n\\nText: A respiratory viral disease caused by the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus (MERS-CoV) was first isolated in 2012, in a 60-year-old man who died in Jeddah, KSA due to severe acute pneumonia and multiple organ failure [1] . Since then, 27 countries have reported the presence of this virus, including the 12 countries of the Eastern Mediterranean region. Several outbreaks have occurred in multiple countries including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and the Republic of Korea [2] . Recent fatality rate (CFR) of 21% [5, 6] . Very limited evidence is available for exploring the epidemiology of this virus among the pediatric population [7] . e literature shows that MERS-CoV infects males more than females [8, 9] . e casefatality rate of men (52%) is higher than that of women (23%) [10] . Males with a history of serious medical conditions are highly susceptible to this infection. Moreover, the mean age of infection in adults is 60 years [10] . e mode of transmission is not entirely understood yet [2] ; however, human-to-human [11] and zoonotic sources of transmission [12] have been documented in many studies. Dromedary camels are the major animal source of MERS-CoV transmission to humans. Interhuman transmission of the virus did not occur easily, but it is seen mainly in patients' families and healthcare settings [2] . Clinical pictures of this infection varied from asymptomatic to mild respiratory symptoms to severe respiratory distress and death [2] . Severe ailment can often cause respiratory catastrophes that need mechanical ventilation and support in ICUs across different healthcare settings [4] . Studies have suggested an incubation period of 16 days with a mean of 5-6 days [12, 13] , while the median time until death is 11-13 days (range 5-27 days) among severely ill patients [13] . e gold standard test for the detection of this virus is real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays [14] .\\n\\nere is no specific treatment for MERS-CoV. Like most viral infections, the treatment options are supportive and symptomatic [2] . At present, no vaccine exists for preventing the infections of MERS-CoV. e CDC indicated that preventative actions should be taken for any type of respiratory illness [4] . Such actions include washing hands with water and soap for around 20 seconds or using hand sanitizers with alcohol if no water is available. One must cover their nose and mouth during instances of sneezing and coughing with a tissue and avoid touching the mouth, nose, or eyes with their hands until washed properly. Repeatedly touched surfaces, such as door knobs, should be disinfected and cleaned regularly. Intimate personal contact, e.g., kissing, and sharing cups or eating utensils must also be avoided [15] .\\n\\nMany studies have been conducted in recent years in Saudi Arabia to combat this deadly disease. A large multicentre study showed that it is nearly impossible to differentiate between patients of MERS-CoV and non-MERS-CoV just on the basis of clinical presentation [16] . Another cohort study, which was hospital-based (17 cases vs. 82 controls), found that there were statistically significant differences in terms of gender, clinical, and radiographic presentations [17] . Similarly, two more single-centre case control studies reported that the presenting symptoms of MERS-CoV infection were not specific [18, 19] .\\n\\nPhysicians and public health practitioners need to identify suspected cases which have higher chances of diagnosis as confirmed cases prior to laboratory testing (which usually takes between 12 and 24 hours). Identification of a confirmed case is necessary to implement preventive strategies to combat the spread of the disease to family members and hospital healthcare workers [20] . Mild symptomatic cases, which result in a positive PCR, may be isolated at home. Severe to moderate cases should be admitted to and isolated in a hospital until they improve and then be discharged for isolation at home for an extended period. Both mild and severe cases are retested after 7 days, and the test is subsequently repeated after every 3 days until a negative result is obtained [20] .\\n\\nIdentifying suspected cases which may have higher chances of getting diagnosed as a confirmed case and implementing strict procedures on them might offer the best solution.\\n\\ne challenge is to flag these patients by some demographic markers, as the clinical presentation of MERS-CoV infected patients were non-specific. erefore, we aimed to identify some demographic markers specific to confirmed cases of MERS-CoV. e nature of these markers has not been investigated in Saudi Arabia, and hence this study aims to identify them.\\n\\nA cross-sectional study was conducted at the regional laboratory and blood bank, located at Shumaisi Hospital in Riyadh, KSA. e laboratory has received the Central Blood Banks and Reference Laboratories Accreditation Program Saudi Central Board for Accreditation of Healthcare Institution (CBAHI) 2018 [21] .\\n\\nTechnique. Data were collected during the period of January 2017 to December 2017. All patients in Riyadh and Al-Qassim regions who had their samples tested at Riyadh regional lab during the study period were considered as suspected cases.\\n\\ne study had two aims: descriptive and analytical. For the descriptive aim, we estimated the prevalence of MERS-CoV. For the analytical aim, a binary logistic regression model was developed. In this model, we included the risk factors of gender, age, seasons, nationality, healthcare status (yes/no), hospitals, and area of residence. Data were cross-checked with a labcomputerized database. Further data were collected on demographic characteristics (age and sex), underlying nationality, and health care status.\\n\\nWe collected data from 25,400 cases, of which 23,646 suspected cases of MERS-CoV were included in the final analysis. Data were cleaned, entered, stored, and managed with an excel database and IBM SPSS Version 25. e statistical analyses consisted of descriptive counts and percentages. For those continuously scaled items, nonparametric statistics (medians, interquartile ranges, minimum, and maximum) were used to describe the distribution. A logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of confirmation of infection within the suspected cases groups. At first, univariate analyses were conducted to estimate the unadjusted contribution and to determine the significant risk factors. is was followed by a multivariate logistic regression analysis to estimate the independent contribution of each covariate. To determine significant factors, a p value below 0.05 and a 95% confidence interval were considered. \\n\\nA confirmed case is defined as a suspected case with laboratory confirmation of MERS-CoV infection [20] . \\n\\nA total of 23,646 of MERS-CoV suspected cases were included in this study, of which 52.3% were males (n � 12376) and 47.7% were females (n � 11270). e age of individuals with suspected cases ranged between 0 to 92 years with a mean age of 43. 23 e adjusted odds of MERS-CoV remained significant among different age groups; the odds of patients aged between 20-40 years increased threefold (A.OR: 3.11, 95% CI: 1.104-8.76, P value � 0.032), whereas in the age group of 41-60 years, it increased further to a risk that was six times higher \\n\\nis cross-sectional study about the epidemiological analysis of MERS-CoV infection laboratory-based data was conducted in Riyadh over a one-year period (2017). A total of 23,646 suspected cases were included in the results. Of the total suspected cases, 119 cases had been confirmed via laboratory results. All the confirmed cases are reported to MOH through HESN (health electronic surveillance networks) and to the World Health Organization (WHO) through the International Health Regulations (IHR), National Focal Point of Saudi Arabia. We found that MERS-CoV infection was found significantly in people aged between 41 and 60 years and was reported most commonly during the summer season. e odds of infection among males were found to be twice as high as that of females with suspected cases.\\n\\nDuring the study period, i.e., the year 2017, only 119 confirmed cases were reported, which means that the number of MERS-CoV infection cases has decreased in Riyadh and Al-Qassim regions in comparison to that of the last three years. From 2015 to 2016, there was a 25.4% decrease, whereas from 2016 to 2017, it decreased by 48.7%, which translates into a 50% decrease between the two periods. is also complements the findings reported by of Da'ar and Ahmed in their paper [23] . e predominance of infection in males was also observed in another study pwefromed in KSA (2015), which reported the percentage of confirmed cases among males to be 66%, compared with 34% among females [24] .\\n\\nIt is worth mentioning that Saudi Arabia defines age categories differently from the WHO (children: 0-14, adult: otherwise) [20] . However, unlike the classification used in Saudi Arabia, we have followed the WHO categorization of age to differentiate between children/adolescents (0 to 19 years) and adults (20 years and older) as indicated in WHO reports for age-standardized population and in infectious diseases [25] . is categorization was also followed by Aly and his collaborators in their recent paper published in 2017 [14] . Adults were further subcategorized into three groups according to the age distribution of the study population using the following two cutoff points (age of 41 and age of 60) [14] .\\n\\nese data agreed with a previous surveillance study, which stated that the majority of confirmed cases of MERS-CoV were reported among people aged 40 and above [24] . In 2016, only 9 of 552 cases (1.6%) of MERS-CoV infection were found among pediatric patients. Moreover, the study which was conducted in King Fahad Medical City in Riyadh (KFMC) between January 2012 and December 2013 did not report any MERS-CoV cases among children [26] . e study which was conducted across the Gulf countries for four years by Mahmoud Aly et al. between 2012 and 2016 suggests that the prevalence and distribution of MERS-CoV were the highest-risk in elderly aged 60 years or above [14] . Similar to our results, this study also reported the highest number of confirmed cases during the summer season [14] .\\n\\nAmong confirmed cases, only 25.2% were healthcare workers, whereas around 75% were non-healthcare workers.\\n\\nis is in agreement with the study done by Ahmad to estimate the survival rate in MERS-CoV globally prior to 26 January 2017; 86.9% were not health-care workers compared with 13.1% confirmed cases of healthcare workers [27] . Similarly, other studies also reported a lower prevalence in healthcare workers [28] [29] [30] .\\n\\nOur data reported a higher prevalence of infection among Saudi nationals as compared with non-Saudi. Another study also showed similar results but with a much higher percentage among Saudis, which may be due to the fact that it included Saudis from all regions [29] . ere is no finding basis for comparison as such, because our study was focused on the Riyadh and Al Qassim regions only.\\n\\nIn our study, we detected a low prevalence (0.5%). e low positive predictive value of our lab results is not related to the low sensitivity and specificity of the lab assay. e estimated analytical sensitivity and specificity of the Real Star kit from Altona was reported to be 100% with no cross reactivity with other respiratory pathogens [31] . Moreover, this low predictive value in the lab results is related to the high burden of false positive cases referred to the lab. In fact, this research is just the starting point to shed the light on more factors that might help in putting more descriptive criteria to lower the financial and human resources burden.\\n\\nTo the best of our knowledge, no one has developed a logistic regression that focuses on demographic risk factors such as sex, age, and seasons prior to our study. However, it is worth mentioning that Ahmed et al. developed a risk prediction model that encompasses risk factors such as chest pain, leukopenia, and elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) [21] . However, further investigations are needed to confirm our findings.\\n\\nOne of the major strengths of our study is that it is a comprehensive regional study which included all the suspected cases of MERS-CoV in the Riyadh and Al-Qassim regions. Secondly, the external validity of our study is also expected to be high, as it covers the two regions completely, meaning that the records of all suspected cases in these two main regions in Saudi Arabia were included. irdly, the quality of the data is considered to be high, given that the contagious and life-threatening nature of this disease has led to strict obedience to rules which are enforced in a timely manner, thus ensuring accurate reporting of suspected cases. In addition to this, quality assurance policies are implemented at HESN in order to maintain the highest level of validity and reliability of the data collection process. e variables available for suspected cases were limited to demographics, which limited the scope of our research, but they provided valuable information to form a basis for future studies of a broader scope. Variables such as primary/secondary infections are vital pieces of information, but due the limitation of the data available, we could not determine their effects.\\n\\nAccording to our knowledge, this is one of the few studies that have specifically investigated MERS-CoV risk factors in the Riyadh and Al-Qassim areas (two major regions in KSA). Given that all suspected and confirmed cases were included in this study, we assume that our results are generalizable for both the regions with confidence. It must be noted that the comparative group of this study is different from that of the previous ones, as we compared those with confirmed MERS-CoV with those with suspected MERS-CoV who have passed all stages of screening at the hospital, whereas other studies were hospital but not lab-based with an aim of identifying factors that help in suspecting rather than confirming cases. is might be the reason why we have found some significant demographic factors unlike other reports.\\n\\nIn conclusion, this research is about predictors for the confirmation of diagnosis among suspected cases only, meaning that the factors we found can help in identifying suspected cases that may have a higher chance of testing positive. is will help primary healthcare professionals to develop a better screening tool for suspected cases, as currently only a small minority of suspected cases are confirmed positive via lab results, consequently resulting in a lot of resources being spent to test thousands of samples, just for the identification of a few cases. e three factors we identified are important because, for example, a female, aged 18, presenting in winter will be less likely to be diagnosed than a male, aged 45, presenting in the summer, or, to give another example, a 60-year-old male who is presenting MERS-CoV signs with a negative lab result may need retesting.\\n\\nOur study covered two main regions in Saudi Arabia and provides evidence that the MERS-CoV epidemic in these two regions has specific characteristics that might help future plans for prevention and management of such contagious diseases. Our results showed that only a minority of suspected cases are actually diagnosed with the disease, meaning that the procedures being implemented seemed to be highly sensitive but not highly specific. e majority of confirmed cases were male, aged 41 to 60 years, and presented to healthcare facilities in the summer. Future studies should aim to confirm such findings in other regions in Saudi Arabia, to explore potential preventable risk factors and go deeper to know the underlying factors that make male aged 41-60 more susceptible than others.\\n\\ne laboratory data used to support the findings of this study were provided by Riyadh Regional Laboratory under license and are not freely available.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the magnitude of mental health outcomes and associated factors among health care workers treating patients exposed to COVID-19 in China. DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional, survey-based, region-stratified study collected demographic data and mental health measurements from 1257 health care workers in 34 hospitals from January 29, 2020, to February 3, 2020, in China. Health care workers in hospitals equipped with fever clinics or wards for patients with COVID-19 were eligible. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The degree of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress was assessed by the Chinese versions of the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, the 7-item Insomnia Severity Index, and the 22-item Impact of Event Scale–Revised, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with mental health outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 1257 of 1830 contacted individuals completed the survey, with a participation rate of 68.7%. A total of 813 (64.7%) were aged 26 to 40 years, and 964 (76.7%) were women. Of all participants, 764 (60.8%) were nurses, and 493 (39.2%) were physicians; 760 (60.5%) worked in hospitals in Wuhan, and 522 (41.5%) were frontline health care workers. A considerable proportion of participants reported symptoms of depression (634 [50.4%]), anxiety (560 [44.6%]), insomnia (427 [34.0%]), and distress (899 [71.5%]). Nurses, women, frontline health care workers, and those working in Wuhan, China, reported more severe degrees of all measurements of mental health symptoms than other health care workers (eg, median [IQR] Patient Health Questionnaire scores among physicians vs nurses: 4.0 [1.0-7.0] vs 5.0 [2.0-8.0]; P = .007; median [interquartile range {IQR}] Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale scores among men vs women: 2.0 [0-6.0] vs 4.0 [1.0-7.0]; P < .001; median [IQR] Insomnia Severity Index scores among frontline vs second-line workers: 6.0 [2.0-11.0] vs 4.0 [1.0-8.0]; P < .001; median [IQR] Impact of Event Scale–Revised scores among those in Wuhan vs those in Hubei outside Wuhan and those outside Hubei: 21.0 [8.5-34.5] vs 18.0 [6.0-28.0] in Hubei outside Wuhan and 15.0 [4.0-26.0] outside Hubei; P < .001). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed participants from outside Hubei province were associated with lower risk of experiencing symptoms of distress compared with those in Wuhan (odds ratio [OR], 0.62; 95% CI, 0.43-0.88; P = .008). Frontline health care workers engaged in direct diagnosis, treatment, and care of patients with COVID-19 were associated with a higher risk of symptoms of depression (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.11-2.09; P = .01), anxiety (OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.22-2.02; P < .001), insomnia (OR, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.92-4.60; P < .001), and distress (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.25-2.04; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this survey of heath care workers in hospitals equipped with fever clinics or wards for patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan and other regions in China, participants reported experiencing psychological burden, especially nurses, women, those in Wuhan, and frontline health care workers directly engaged in the diagnosis, treatment, and care for patients with COVID-19.\\n\\nText: Abbreviation: PHQ-9, 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire; GAD-7, 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder; ISI, 7-item Insomnia Severity Index; IES-R, 22-item Impact of Event Abbreviation: IES-R, 22-item Impact of Event Scale-Revised; IQR, interquartile range.

Over the last 20 years, there has been a substantial decrease in the incidence of childhood pneumonia and pneumonia-associated mortality. New conjugate vaccines against Haemophilus influenzae type b and Streptococcus pneumoniae have contributed to decreases in radiologic, clinical and complicated pneumonia cases and have reduced hospitalization and mortality. The importance of co-infections with multiple pathogens and the predominance of viral-associated disease are emerging. Better access to effective preventative and management strategies is needed in low- and middle-income countries, while new strategies are needed to address the residual burden of disease once these have been implemented.\\n\\nText: Pneumonia has been the leading cause of death in children younger than 5 years for decades. Although there have been substantial decreases in overall child mortality and in pneumonia-specific mortality, pneumonia remains the major single cause of death in children outside the neonatal period, causing approximately 900,000 of the estimated 6.3 million child deaths in 2013 [1] . Substantial advances have occurred in the understanding of risk factors and etiology of pneumonia, in development of standardized case definitions, and in prevention with the production of improved vaccines and in treatment. Such advances have led to changes in the epidemiology, etiology and mortality from childhood pneumonia. However in many areas access to these interventions remains sub-optimal, with large inequities between and within countries and regions. In this paper we review the impact of recent preventative and management advances in pneumonia epidemiology, etiology, radiologic presentation and outcome in children.\\n\\nThe overall burden of childhood pneumonia has been reduced substantially over the last decade, despite an increase in the global childhood population from 605 million in 2000 to 664 million in 2015 [2] . Recent data suggest that there has been a 25% decrease in the incidence of pneumonia, from 0.29 episodes per child year in low-and middle-income countries in 2000, to 0.22 episodes per child year in 2010 [3] . This is substantiated by a 58% decrease in pneumonia-associated disability-adjusted life years between 1990 and 2013, from 186 million to 78 million as estimated in the Global Burden of Disease study [1] . Pneumonia deaths decreased from 1.8 million in 2000 to 900,000 in 2013 [1] . These data do not reflect the full impact of increasingly widespread use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in low-and middle-income countries because the incidence of pneumonia and number of deaths are likely to decrease still further as a result of this widespread intervention [4] .\\n\\nNotwithstanding this progress, there remains a disproportionate burden of disease in low-and middle-income countries, where more than 90% of pneumonia cases and deaths occur. The incidence in high-income countries is estimated at 0.015 episodes per child year, compared to 0.22 episodes per child year in low-and middle-income countries [3] . On average, 1 in 66 children in high-income countries is affected by pneumonia per year, compared to 1 in 5 children in low-and middle-income countries. Even within low-and middleincome countries there are regional inequities and challenges with access to health care services: up to 81% of severe pneumonia deaths occur outside a hospital [5] . In addition to a higher incidence of pneumonia, the case fatality rate is estimated to be almost 10-fold higher in low-and middle-income countries as compared to high-income countries [3, 5] .\\n\\nChildhood pneumonia can also lead to significant morbidity and chronic disease. Early life pneumonia can impair longterm lung health by decreasing lung function [6] . Severe or recurrent pneumonia can have a worse effect on lung function; increasing evidence suggests that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease might be related to early childhood pneumonia [7, 8] . A meta-analysis of the risk of long-term outcomes after childhood pneumonia categorized chronic respiratory sequelae into major (restrictive lung disease, obstructive lung disease, bronchiectasis) and minor (chronic bronchitis, asthma, abnormal pulmonary function) groups [9] . The risk of developing at least one of the major sequelae was estimated as 6% after an ambulatory pneumonia event and 14% after an episode of hospitalized pneumonia. Because respiratory diseases affect almost 1 billion people globally and are a major cause of mortality and morbidity [10] , childhood pneumonia might contribute to substantial morbidity across the life course.\\n\\nChest radiologic changes have been considered the gold standard for defining a pneumonia event [11] because clinical findings can be subjective and clinical definitions of pneumonia can be nonspecific. In 2005, to aid in defining outcomes of pneumococcal vaccine studies, the World Health Organization\\'s (WHO) standardized chest radiograph description defined a group of children who were considered most likely to have pneumococcal pneumonia [12] . The term \"end-point consolidation\" was described as a dense or fluffy opacity that occupies a portion or whole of a lobe, or the entire lung. \"Other infiltrate\" included linear and patchy densities, peribronchial thickening, minor patchy infiltrates that are not of sufficient magnitude to constitute primary end-point consolidation, and small areas of atelectasis that in children can be difficult to distinguish from consolidation. \"Primary end-point pneumonia\" included either end-point consolidation or a pleural effusion associated with a pulmonary parenchymal infiltrate (including \"other\" infiltrate).\\n\\nWidespread use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination and Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccination has decreased the incidence of radiologic pneumonia. In a review of four randomized controlled trials and two case-control studies of Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccination in high-burden communities, the vaccination was associated with an 18% decrease in radiologic pneumonia [13] . Introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination was associated with a 26% decrease in radiologic pneumonia in California between 1995 and 1998 [14] . In vaccine efficacy trials in low-and middle-income countries, pneumococcal conjugate vaccination reduced radiologic pneumonia by 37% in the Gambia [15] , 25% in South Africa [16] and 26% in the Philippines [17] .\\n\\nThe WHO radiologic case definition was not intended to distinguish bacterial from viral etiology but rather to define a sub-set of pneumonia cases in which pneumococcal infection was considered more likely and to provide a set of standardized definitions through which researchers could achieve broad agreement in reporting chest radiographs. However, despite widespread field utilization, there are concerns regarding inter-observer repeatability. There has been good consensus for the description of lobar consolidation but significant disagreement on the description of patchy and perihilar infiltrates [18, 19] . In addition, many children with clinically severe lung disease do not have primary end-point pneumonia: in one pre-pneumococcal conjugate vaccination study, only 34% of children hospitalized with pneumonia had primary end-point pneumonia [20] . A revised case definition of \"presumed bacterial pneumonia\" has been introduced, and this definition includes pneumonia cases with WHO-defined alveolar consolidation, as well as those with other abnormal chest radiograph infiltrates and a serum C-reactive protein of at least 40 mg/L [21, 22] . This definition has been shown to have greater sensitivity than the original WHO radiologic definition of primary end-point pneumonia for detecting the burden of pneumonia prevented by pneumococcal conjugate vaccination [23] . Using the revised definition, the 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-10), had a vaccine efficacy of 22% in preventing presumed bacterial pneumonia in young children in South America [22] , and pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-13 had a vaccine efficacy of 39% in preventing presumed bacterial pneumonia in children older than 16 weeks who were not infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in South Africa [21] . Thus there is convincing evidence that pneumococcal conjugate vaccination decreases the incidence of radiologic pneumonia; however there is no evidence to suggest that pneumococcal conjugate vaccination modifies the radiologic appearance of pneumococcal pneumonia.\\n\\nEmpyema is a rare complication of pneumonia. An increased incidence of empyema in children was noted in some high-income countries following pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7 introduction, and this was attributed to pneumococcal serotypes not included in pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7, especially 3 and 19A [24] . In the United States, evidence from a national hospital database suggests that the incidence of empyema increased 1.9-fold between 1996 and 2008 [25] . In Australia, the incidence rate ratio increased by 1.4 times when comparing the pre-pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7 period (1998 to 2004) to the post-pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7 period (2005 to 2010) [26] . In Scotland, incidence of empyema in children rose from 6.5 per million between 1981 and 1998, to 66 per million in 2005 [27] . These trends have been reversed since the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-13. Data from the United States suggest that empyema decreased by 50% in children younger than 5 years [28] ; similarly, data from the United Kingdom and Scotland showed substantial reduction in pediatric empyema following pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-13 introduction [29, 30] .\\n\\nSeveral national guidelines from high-income countries, as well as the WHO recommendations for low-and middleincome countries, recommend that chest radiography should not be routinely performed in children with ambulatory pneumonia [31] [32] [33] . Indications for chest radiography include hospitalization, severe hypoxemia or respiratory distress, failed initial antibiotic therapy, or suspicion for other diseases (tuberculosis, inhaled foreign body) or complications. However, point-of-care lung ultrasound is emerging as a promising modality for diagnosing childhood pneumonia [34] .\\n\\nIn addition to the effect on radiologic pneumonia, pneumococcal conjugate vaccination reduces the risk of hospitalization from viral-associated pneumonia, probably by reducing bacterial-viral co-infections resulting in severe disease and hospitalization [35] . An analysis of ecological and observational studies of pneumonia incidence in different age groups soon after introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7 in Canada, Italy, Australia, Poland and the United States showed decreases in all-cause pneumonia hospitalizations ranging from 15% to 65% [36] . In the United States after pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-13 replaced pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7, there was a further 17% decrease in hospitalizations for pneumonia among children eligible for the vaccination, and a further 12% decrease among unvaccinated adults [28] .\\n\\nA systematic review of etiology studies prior to availability of new conjugate vaccines confirmed S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae type B as the most important bacterial causes of pneumonia, with Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae associated with some severe cases. Respiratory syncytial virus was the leading viral cause, identified in 15-40% of pneumonia cases, followed by influenza A and B, parainfluenza, human metapneumovirus and adenovirus [37] .\\n\\nMore recent meta-analyses of etiology data suggest a changing pathogen profile, with increasing recognition that clinical pneumonia is caused by the sequential or concurrent interaction of more than one organism. Severe disease in particular is often caused by multiple pathogens. With high coverage of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination and Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccination, viral pathogens increasingly predominate [38] . In recent case-control studies, at least one virus was detected in 87% of clinical pneumonia cases in South Africa [39] , while viruses were detected in 81% of radiologic pneumonia cases in Sweden [40] . In a large multi-center study in the United States, viral pathogens were detected in 73% of children hospitalized with radiologic pneumonia, while bacteria were detected in only 15% of cases [41] . A meta-analysis of 23 case-control studies of viral etiology in radiologically confirmed pneumonia in children, completed up to 2014, reported good evidence of causal attribution for respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, metapneumovirus and parainfluenza virus [42] . However there was no consistent evidence that many other commonly described viruses, including rhinovirus, adenovirus, bocavirus and coronavirus, were more commonly isolated from cases than from controls. Further attribution of bacterial etiology is difficult because it is often not possible to distinguish colonizing from pathogenic bacteria when they are isolated from nasal specimens [43] .\\n\\nAnother etiology is pertussis. In the last decade there has also been a resurgence in pertussis cases, especially in highincome countries [44] . Because pertussis immunity after acellular pertussis vaccination is less long-lasting than immunity after wild-type infection or whole-cell vaccination, many women of child-bearing age have waning pertussis antibody levels. Their infants might therefore be born with low transplacental anti-pertussis immunoglobulin G levels, making them susceptible to pertussis infection before completion of the primary vaccination series [45] . In 2014, more than 40,000 pertussis cases were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States; in some states, population-based incidence rates are higher than at any time in the last 70 years [44] . In contrast, most low-and middleincome countries use whole-cell pertussis vaccines and the numbers of pertussis cases in those countries were stable or decreasing until 2015 [46] . However recent evidence from South Africa (where the acellular vaccine is used) shows an appreciable incidence of pertussis among infants presenting with acute pneumonia: 2% of clinical pneumonia cases among infants enrolled in a birth cohort were caused by pertussis [39] , and 3.7% of infants and young children presenting to a tertiary academic hospital had evidence of pertussis infection [47] .\\n\\nSimilarly, childhood tuberculosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in many low-and middle-income countries, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis has increasingly been recognized as a pathogen in acute pneumonia in children living in high tuberculosis-prevalence settings. Postmortem studies of children dying from acute respiratory illness have commonly reported M. tuberculosis [48, 49] . A recent systematic review of tuberculosis as a comorbidity of childhood pneumonia reported culture-confirmed disease in about 8% of cases [50] . Because intrathoracic tuberculosis disease is only culture-confirmed in a minority of cases, the true burden could be even higher; tuberculosis could therefore be an important contributor to childhood pneumonia incidence and mortality in high-prevalence areas.\\n\\nChildhood pneumonia and clinically severe disease result from a complex interaction of host and environmental risk factors [37] . Because of the effectiveness of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination and Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccination for prevention of radiologic and clinical pneumonia, incomplete or inadequate vaccination must be considered as a major preventable risk factor for childhood pneumonia. Other risk factors include low birth weight, which is associated with 3.2 times increased odds of severe pneumonia in low-and middle-income countries, and 1.8 times increased odds in high-income countries [51] . Similarly, lack of exclusive breastfeeding for the first 4 months of life increases odds of severe pneumonia by 2.7 times in low-and middle-income countries and 1.3 times in highincome countries. Markers of undernutrition are strong risk factors for pneumonia in low-and middle-income countries only, with highly significant odds ratios for underweight for age (4.5), stunting (2.6) and wasting (2.8) . Household crowding has uniform risk, with odds ratios between 1.9 and 2.3 in both low-and middle-income countries and high-income countries. Indoor air pollution from use of solid or biomass fuels increases odds of pneumonia by 1.6 times; lack of measles vaccination by the end of the first year of age increases odds of pneumonia by 1.8 times [51] . It is estimated that the prevalence of these critical risk factors in low-and middle-income countries decreased by 25% between 2000 and 2010, contributing to reductions in pneumonia incidence and mortality in low-and middle-income countries, even in countries where conjugate vaccines have not been available [3] .\\n\\nThe single strongest risk factor for pneumonia is HIV infection, which is especially prevalent in children in sub-Saharan Africa. HIV-infected children have 6 times increased odds of developing severe pneumonia or of death compared to HIV-uninfected children [52] . Since the effective prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV, there is a growing population of HIV-exposed children who are uninfected; their excess risk of pneumonia, compared to HIV unexposed children, has been described as 1.3-to 3.4-fold higher [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] .\\n\\nThe pneumococcal conjugate vaccination and Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccination have been effective tools to decrease pneumonia incidence, severity and mortality [58, 59] . However, equitable coverage and access to vaccines remains sub-optimal. By the end of 2015, Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccination had been introduced in 73 countries, with global coverage estimated at 68%. However, inequities are still apparent among regions: in the Americas coverage is estimated at 90%, while in the Western Pacific it is only 25%. By 2015, pneumococcal conjugate vaccination had been introduced into 54 countries, with global coverage of 35% for three doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination for infant populations [60] . To address this issue, the WHO\\'s Global Vaccine Access Plan initiative was launched to make life-saving vaccines more equitably available. In addition to securing guarantees for financing of vaccines, the program objectives include building political will in low-and middle-income countries to commit to immunization as a priority, social marketing to individuals and communities, strengthening health systems and promoting relevant local research and development innovations [61] .\\n\\nMaternal vaccination to prevent disease in the youngest infants has been shown to be effective for tetanus, influenza and pertussis [62] . Influenza vaccination during pregnancy is safe, provides reasonable maternal protection against influenza, and also protects infants for a limited period from confirmed influenza infection (vaccine efficacy 63% in Bangladesh [63] and 50.4% in South Africa [64] ). However as antibody levels drop sharply after birth, infant protection does not persist much beyond 8 weeks [65] . Recently respiratory syncytial virus vaccination in pregnancy has been shown to be safe and immunogenic, and a phase-3 clinical trial of efficacy at preventing respiratory syncytial virus disease in infants is under way [66] . Within a decade, respiratory syncytial virus in infancy might be vaccine-preventable, with further decreases in pneumonia incidence, morbidity and mortality [67] .\\n\\nImproved access to health care, better nutrition and improved living conditions might contribute to further decreases in childhood pneumonia burden. The WHO Integrated Global Action Plan for diarrhea and pneumonia highlights many opportunities to protect, prevent and treat children [68] . Breastfeeding rates can be improved by programs that combine education and counseling interventions in homes, communities and health facilities, and by promotion of baby-friendly hospitals [69] . Improved home ventilation, cleaner cooking fuels and reduction in exposure to cigarette smoke are essential interventions to reduce the incidence and severity of pneumonia [70, 71] . Prevention of pediatric HIV is possible by providing interventions to prevent mother-to-child transmission [72] . Early infant HIV testing and early initiation of antiretroviral therapy and cotrimoxazole prophylaxis can substantially reduce the incidence of community-acquired pneumonia among HIV-infected children [73] . Community-based interventions reduce pneumonia mortality and have the indirect effect of improved-careseeking behavior [58] . If these cost-effective interventions were scaled up, it is estimated that 67% of pneumonia deaths in lowand middle-income countries could be prevented by 2025 [58] .\\n\\nCase management of pneumonia is a strategy by which severity of disease is classified as severe or non-severe. All children receive early, appropriate oral antibiotics, and severe cases are referred for parenteral antibiotics. When implemented in highburden areas before the availability of conjugate vaccines, case management as part of Integrated Management of Childhood Illness was associated with a 27% decrease in overall child mortality, and 42% decrease in pneumonia-specific mortality [74] . However the predominance of viral causes of pneumonia and low case fatality have prompted concern about overuse of antibiotics. Several randomized controlled trials comparing oral antibiotics to placebo for non-severe pneumonia have been performed [75] [76] [77] and others are ongoing [78] . In two studies, performed in Denmark and in India, outcomes of antibiotic and placebo treatments were equivalent [76, 77] . In the third study, in Pakistan, there was a non-significant 24% vs. 20% rate of failure in the placebo group, which was deemed to be non-equivalent to the antibiotic group [75] . Furthermore, because WHO-classified non-severe pneumonia and bronchiolitis might be considered within a spectrum of lower respiratory disease, many children with clinical pneumonia could actually have viral bronchiolitis, for which antibiotics are not beneficial [79] . This has been reflected in British [33] and Spanish [31] national pneumonia guidelines, which do not recommend routine antibiotic treatment for children younger than 2 years with evidence of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination who present with non-severe pneumonia. The United States\\' national guidelines recommend withholding antibiotics in children up to age 5 years presenting with non-severe pneumonia [32] . However, given the high mortality from pneumonia in low-and middle-income countries, the lack of easy access to care, and the high prevalence of risk factors for severe disease, revised World Health Organization pneumonia guidelines still recommend antibiotic treatment for all children who meet the WHO pneumonia case definitions [80] .\\n\\nUse of supplemental oxygen is life-saving, but this is not universally available in low-and middle-income countries; it is estimated that use of supplemental oxygen systems could reduce mortality of children with hypoxic pneumonia by 20% [81] . Identifying systems capacity to increase availability of oxygen in health facilities, and identifying barriers to further implementation are among the top 15 priorities for future childhood pneumonia research [82] . However, up to 81% of pneumonia deaths in 2010 occurred outside health facilities [5] , so there are major challenges with access to health services and health-seeking behavior of vulnerable populations. Identifying and changing the barriers to accessing health care is an important area with the potential to impact the survival and health of the most vulnerable children [82] .\\n\\nMuch progress has been made in decreasing deaths caused by childhood pneumonia. Improved socioeconomic status and vaccinations, primarily the conjugate vaccines (against Haemophilus influenzae and pneumococcus), have led to substantial reductions in the incidence and severity of childhood pneumonia. Stronger strategies to prevent and manage HIV have reduced HIV-associated pneumonia deaths. However, despite the substantial changes in incidence, etiology and radiology globally, there remain inequities in access to care and availability of effective interventions, especially in low-and middle-income countries. Effective interventions need to be more widely available and new interventions developed for the residual burden of childhood pneumonia.'}}>,\n",

OBJECTIVE: To assess the magnitude of mental health outcomes and associated factors among health care workers treating patients exposed to COVID-19 in China. DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional, survey-based, region-stratified study collected demographic data and mental health measurements from 1257 health care workers in 34 hospitals from January 29, 2020, to February 3, 2020, in China. Health care workers in hospitals equipped with fever clinics or wards for patients with COVID-19 were eligible. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The degree of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress was assessed by the Chinese versions of the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, the 7-item Insomnia Severity Index, and the 22-item Impact of Event Scale–Revised, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with mental health outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 1257 of 1830 contacted individuals completed the survey, with a participation rate of 68.7%. A total of 813 (64.7%) were aged 26 to 40 years, and 964 (76.7%) were women. Of all participants, 764 (60.8%) were nurses, and 493 (39.2%) were physicians; 760 (60.5%) worked in hospitals in Wuhan, and 522 (41.5%) were frontline health care workers. A considerable proportion of participants reported symptoms of depression (634 [50.4%]), anxiety (560 [44.6%]), insomnia (427 [34.0%]), and distress (899 [71.5%]). Nurses, women, frontline health care workers, and those working in Wuhan, China, reported more severe degrees of all measurements of mental health symptoms than other health care workers (eg, median [IQR] Patient Health Questionnaire scores among physicians vs nurses: 4.0 [1.0-7.0] vs 5.0 [2.0-8.0]; P = .007; median [interquartile range {IQR}] Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale scores among men vs women: 2.0 [0-6.0] vs 4.0 [1.0-7.0]; P < .001; median [IQR] Insomnia Severity Index scores among frontline vs second-line workers: 6.0 [2.0-11.0] vs 4.0 [1.0-8.0]; P < .001; median [IQR] Impact of Event Scale–Revised scores among those in Wuhan vs those in Hubei outside Wuhan and those outside Hubei: 21.0 [8.5-34.5] vs 18.0 [6.0-28.0] in Hubei outside Wuhan and 15.0 [4.0-26.0] outside Hubei; P < .001). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed participants from outside Hubei province were associated with lower risk of experiencing symptoms of distress compared with those in Wuhan (odds ratio [OR], 0.62; 95% CI, 0.43-0.88; P = .008). Frontline health care workers engaged in direct diagnosis, treatment, and care of patients with COVID-19 were associated with a higher risk of symptoms of depression (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.11-2.09; P = .01), anxiety (OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.22-2.02; P < .001), insomnia (OR, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.92-4.60; P < .001), and distress (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.25-2.04; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this survey of heath care workers in hospitals equipped with fever clinics or wards for patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan and other regions in China, participants reported experiencing psychological burden, especially nurses, women, those in Wuhan, and frontline health care workers directly engaged in the diagnosis, treatment, and care for patients with COVID-19.\\n\\nText: Abbreviation: PHQ-9, 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire; GAD-7, 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder; ISI, 7-item Insomnia Severity Index; IES-R, 22-item Impact of Event Abbreviation: IES-R, 22-item Impact of Event Scale-Revised; IQR, interquartile range.

In this study, microRNA, mRNA and cytokine/chemokine secretion profiling were investigated for human monocyte-derived macrophages infected in-vitro with Influenza virus A/H1N1 and/or Streptococcus pneumoniae. We observed that the in-vitro co-infection synergistically increased interferon-γ-induced protein-10 (CXCL10, IP-10) expression compared to the singly-infected cells conditions. We demonstrated that endogenous miRNA-200a-3p, whose expression was synergistically induced following co-infection, indirectly regulates CXCL10 expression by targeting suppressor of cytokine signaling-6 (SOCS-6), a well-known regulator of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Additionally, in a subsequent clinical pilot study, immunomodulators levels were evaluated in samples from 74 children (≤5 years-old) hospitalized with viral and/or bacterial community-acquired pneumonia. Clinically, among the 74 cases of pneumonia, patients with identified mixed-detection had significantly higher (3.6-fold) serum IP-10 levels than those with a single detection (P = 0.03), and were significantly associated with severe pneumonia (P < 0.01). This study demonstrates that viral and bacterial co-infection modulates the JAK-STAT signaling pathway and leads to exacerbated IP-10 expression, which could play a major role in the pathogenesis of pneumonia.\\n\\nText: Scientific RepoRts | 6:38532 | DOI: 10 .1038/srep38532 pathogenesis of several diseases and has been suggested as a potential biomarker of viral infection 10, 11 , late-onset bacterial infection in premature infants 12 , and a promising biomarker of sepsis and septic shock 13, 14 . Combined analysis of IP-10 and IFN-γ has also been reported as a useful biomarker for diagnosis and monitoring therapeutic efficacy in patients with active tuberculosis [15] [16] [17] , and both remain detectable in the urine of patients with pulmonary diseases in the absence of renal dysfunction 18 .\\n\\nWith airway epithelial cells 19 , resident alveolar macrophages (AMs) and blood monocytes-derived macrophages (recruited into tissues under inflammatory conditions 20, 21 ) represent a major line of defense against both pneumococcal (through their high phagocytic capacity [22] [23] [24] ) and influenza infection 25, 26 . So far, no studies have yet focused on the intracellular mechanisms that regulate IP-10 in human blood leukocytes during mixed IAV and SP infection. Several studies indicated that host non-coding small RNAs (including microRNAs) may function as immunomodulators by regulating several pivotal intracellular processes, such as the innate immune response 27 and antiviral activity 28, 29 ; both of these processes are closely related to toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways.\\n\\nIn this study, we firstly investigated the in vitro intracellular mechanisms that mediate the innate immune response in IAV and/or SP infected human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). Using this approach, we observed that mixed-infection of MDMs induces a synergistic production of IP-10 which can be related to a miRNA-200a/JAK-STAT/SOCS-6 regulatory pathway. Subsequently, in a retrospective analysis of clinical samples collected from children ≤ 5 years-old hospitalized with pneumonia, we confirmed that serum IP-10 level could be related to both viral and/or bacterial etiologies and disease severity.\\n\\nCharacteristics of MDMs infected by IAV and/or SP. Initially, we investigated in vitro the impact of single and mixed IAV and SP infection on MDMs. Firstly, active replication of IAV was assessed by qRT-PCR and quantification of new infectious viral particles in the cell supernatants ( Fig. 1a,b ). IAV titer increased over time after single infection with IAV and correlated with increased production of negative-strand IAV RNA. Maximum viral replication was observed at 18-24 hours post-infection, after which time both RNA replication and the quantity of infectious particles decreased. In this in vitro model, subsequent challenge of IAV-infected MDMs with SP had no significant impact on the production of new infectious viral particles (Fig. 1b) . Together, these results indicate permissive and productive infection of MDMs by IAV. Secondly, we evaluated whether MDMs are permissive for both IAV and SP infection. The presence of pneumococci within IAV-and SP-infected primary MDMs was confirmed at 8 h post-infection (Fig. 1c) , suggesting that MDMs are permissive for viral and bacterial co-infection in the early steps of infection. Importantly, confocal co-detection of mixed IAV and SP was only effective following 8 h post-infection due to the bactericidal impact of SP internalization within human macrophages (after 24 h, data not shown). Thirdly, we evaluated the impact of single and mixed infection with IAV and SP on MDM viability. Mixed infection significantly decreased cell viability (65.2 ± 4.5% total cell death at 48 hours post-infection; P < 0.0001) compared to single SP and IAV infection (39.6 ± 1.7% and 17.4 ± 1.1% total cell death, respectively; Fig. 1d ). Taken together, these results confirmed human MDMs are permissive to mixed viral and bacterial infection. mRNA, microRNA and protein expression profiling reveal an overall induction of the host innate immune response following IAV and/or SP infection of MDMs. To investigate the innate immune response orchestrated by IAV-and SP-infected human MDMs, we firstly evaluated the expression of 84 genes involved in the innate and adaptive immune responses (Table S1) ; the major differentially-expressed genes are summarized in Fig. 2a . Expression profiling indicated an overall induction of genes related to the JAK-STAT, NF-Κ β and TLR signaling pathways. Indeed, all interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) screened, including CXCL10 (fold-change [FC] = 240.9), CCL-2 (FC = 34.2) and MX-1 (FC = 151.4) were upregulated following mixed infection compared to uninfected cells, most of which are closely related to STAT-1 (FC = 52.3), IRF-7 (FC = 6.8) and IFNB1 (FC = 5.2) also found upregulated in mixed infected cells. Secondly, we investigated the endogenous microRNA expression profiles of IAV-and SP-infected MDMs. A selection of microRNAs that were found to be differentially-expressed under different infection conditions are shown in Fig. 2b and Table S2 . MiRNA-200a-3p was overexpressed after both single IAV (FC = 6.9), single SP (FC = 3.7) and mixed IAV/SP infection (FC = 7.3), indicating this miRNA may play a role in the innate immune response to viral and bacterial co-infection. Similar miRNA-200a-3p dysregulation profiles were obtained following IAV and/or SP infections of human macrophages-like (THP-1 monocytes-derived macrophages) or primary MDMs (data not shown). Thirdly, the secreted levels of various antiviral, pro-inflammatory and immunomodulatory cytokines/chemokines were assayed in IAV-and SP-infected-THP-1 and primary MDM cell supernatants. We observed a remarkable correlation between the mRNA and protein expression profiles of single or mixed infected MDMs especially regarding CXCL-10 and IP-10 expression. Indeed, the level of IP-10 was synergistically increased in the supernatant of IAV-infected THP-1 MDMs exposed to SP (mean: 30,589 ± 16,484 pg ml −1 ) compared to single IAV infection (1,439 ± 566.5 pg ml −1 ) and single SP infection (4,472 ± 2,001 pg ml −1 ; P≤ 0.05; Fig. 2c ) at 24 hours after infection. In those cells, IP-10 expression reduced over time (48 to 72 hours), coinciding with a significant higher proportion of necrotic and apoptotic cells (Fig. 1d) . The synergistic expression of IP-10 was similarly observed at 24 hours post-infection using primary MDMs (Fig. 2d) . Significantly increased secretion of the other tested cytokines and chemokines was not observed post-infection, even in mixed infected MDMs (Fig. S1 ). Interestingly, a significant production of IP-10 was also observed in supernatants of primary human airway epithelial cells (HAEC) mixed-infected by IAV and SP compared to the single infections (Fig. 2e) . Taken together, the mRNA and protein profiling results suggested that mixed viral and bacterial infection of MDMs induces a synergistic pro-inflammatory response related to the type-1 interferon and JAK-STAT signaling pathways, with IP-10 as signature of IAV/SP co-infection. Among all microRNAs screened, miR-200a-3p was the most Scientific RepoRts | 6:38532 | DOI: 10.1038/srep38532 overexpressed in IAV/SP co-infection of human MDMs. In the remainder of this study, we decided to investigate the interconnection between miR-200a-3p expression and the innate immune response.\\n\\nEndogenous miRNA-200a-3p expression correlates with CXCL10 (IP-10) induction following mixed IAV and SP infection of human MDMs. Using a specific Taqman probe assay targeting miR-200a-3p, we confirmed a significant upregulation of miR-200a-3p following mixed IAV and SP infection of human MDMs (Fig. 3a) . In this experiment, a more marked up-regulation of miR-200a-3p was observed following IAV+ SP compared to results obtained previously (Fig. 2b) . This discrepancy has been attributed to the use of two different approaches to quantify miR-200a-3p expression. The use of a target-specific stem-loop reverse transcription primer in Fig. 3a allows a better sensitivity of miR-200a-3p detection compared to the non-specific fluorescent dye used in Fig. 2b . As the general trend was suggestive of a synergistic induction of miR-200a-3p in response to mixed infection (Fig. 3a) , we hypothesized microRNA-200a-3p may play a role in the regulation of CXCL10 (IP-10), which was also synergistically upregulated in mixed-infected MDMs ( Fig. 2c and d) and primary HAEC ( Statistical analyses were performed using two-way ANOVA with Tukey\\'s post-hoc test; *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001.\\n\\nScientific RepoRts | 6:38532 | DOI: 10.1038/srep38532 CXCL10 (Fig. 3d) . These results suggested miR-200a-3p indirectly regulates CXCL10 and led us to hypothesize that miR-200a-3p controls a potential repressor of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. . At 18 h after transfection, the MDMs were singly or mixed infected as described previously. At 8 h post-IAV and/or SP infection, total mRNA was extracted and amplified by PCR using specific primers for the indicated genes. Values represent median ± IQR (a, c) or mean ± SEM (d, e) of three biological replicates. Statistical analyses were performed using a Kruskal-Wallis test (non-parametric, one-way ANOVA with Dunn\\'s post-hoc test) for data presented in (a, c). An ordinary two-way ANOVA (with Tukey\\'s post-hoc multiple comparison test) was used for data presented in (d, e). *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001. MiRNA-200a-3p indirectly regulates IP-10 expression by targeting SOCS6. As shown in Fig. 2a , several JAK-STAT signaling pathway genes were deregulated in mixed IAV-and SP-infected human MDMs; therefore, we hypothesized that miR-200a-3p directly regulates a regulator of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Predictive target analysis indicated that the 3\\' UTR of suppressor of cytokine signaling-6 (SOCS6) may be targeted by miR-200a-3p (Fig. 3b) . SOCS proteins constitute a class of negative regulators of JAK-STAT signaling pathways that are induced by both cytokines and TLR signaling. MiRNA-200a-3p was not predicted to target any of the other six members of the SOCS gene family. Transfection of human MDMs with MIM-200a downregulated SOCS6 (FC = 0.57) while inhibition of miR-200a-3p (INH-200a) upregulated SOCS6 (FC = 1.55), confirming that miR-200a-3p effectively regulates the expression of SOCS6 (Fig. 3e) . Moreover, SOCS6 was synergistically downregulated in IAV-or IAV/SP-infected MDMs overexpressing miRNA-200a (Fig. 3e) , suggesting that both infection and miR-200a-3p negatively regulate the expression of SOCS6. Finally, western blotting confirmed that expression of SOCS-6 sharply reduced following infection, especially after mixed IAV and SP infection (Fig. 3f) .\\n\\nThese results indicate miR-200a-3p is strongly induced in response to mixed viral and bacterial co-infection, which in turn leads to downregulation of the JAK-STAT regulator SOCS-6 at both the mRNA and protein levels and subsequent upregulation of IP-10.\\n\\nanalyses demonstrated mixed IAV and SP infection of human MDMs and HAEC induced significant production of IP-10. As blood leukocytes and respiratory tract epithelial cells actively contribute to inflammation during pneumonia, we hypothesized the level of IP-10 in serum of patient with pneumonia may be both indicative of mixed respiratory infection and disease severity. As part of a prospective, hospital-based, multicenter case-control study on the etiology of pneumonia among children under 5-years-old, a total of 74 patients (44 male, 30 female) were included in this pilot evaluation. According to WHO guidelines, retrospective analysis indicated 44 (59.5%) children had clinical signs of non-severe pneumonia and 30 (40.5%) children had signs of severe pneumonia. The main patient characteristics at inclusion are shown in Table 1 . Patients with severe pneumonia had significant more recorded episodes of dyspnea (P < 0.001), cyanosis (P = 0.03), lower chest indrawing (P < 0.001), dullness to percussion (P < 0.001) and lethargy (P < 0.001) during chest examination than patient with non-severe pneumonia. Moreover, pleural effusions were significantly more observed among critically ill patients and the duration of hospitalization was significantly longer for the children with severe pneumonia than for those with non-severe pneumonia (P = 0.0015). Two deaths occurred within the group of children retrospectively defined with severe pneumonia. Evaluation of the systemic inflammatory response of the 74 cases is shown in Table 2 . Serum level of CRP, IP-10, PCT, G-CSF, IL-6, IL-8 and MIP-1β were significantly more elevated in serum samples from critically ill patients. Patients with severe pneumonia had significantly higher (4.2-fold) serum IP-10 levels than those with a non-severe pneumonia (P < 0.001) suggesting IP-10 as a promising prognostic marker in pneumonia. Diagnostic accuracy measures for predicting pneumonia severity using blood-based biomarkers are summarized in Table S3 . Briefly, in this study, the optimal IP-10 cut-off value for identifying patient with severe pneumonia was 4,240 pg ml −1 , with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.69 (95% CI, 0.57 to 0.82, P < 0.001). Defining as positive a serum IP-10 level above this cut-off resulted in a sensitivity of 63.3%, specificity of 63.6% and a positive likelihood ratio of 1.74. Prognostic values of IP-10 were closed to procalcitonin (PCT; AUC = 0.70; 95% IC, 0.58 to 0.82, P < 0.001) and IL-6 (AUC = 0.70; 95% IC, 0.58-0.83, P < 0.001).\\n\\nMultiplex PCR-based screening of respiratory and blood samples reveal a high variety of pathogen associations (Table 3) . Respiratory viruses were detected in the nasal aspirates (NAs) of 63/74 patients (85.1%). Etiological bacteria of pneumonia (S. pneumoniae, n = 19; S. aureus, n = 1; or H. influenzae type B, n = 7) were identified via real-time PCR in the blood samples of 27/74 (36.5%) of the patients. Multiplex PCR assays allowed the identification of respiratory bacteria in the blood of 19 patients with negative blood culture results. Among the 74 cases PCR-positive for respiratory pathogens, a single virus or bacteria were detected in the NAs of 7 (9.4%) and 3 (4.0%) patients, respectively; these 10/74 (13.5%) cases were defined as the single infection group. The mixed infection group included the 62/74 (83.8%) cases in which (1) multiple viruses and/or bacteria were identified in NAs (38/74; 51.3%) without any bacteria identified in blood samples or (2) one or more viruses and/or bacteria were identified in NAs and associated with a blood bacteremia (24/74; 32.4%). We evaluated whether IP-10 serum level could correlate with the viral and bacterial etiologies of pneumonia. Patients with mixed infection had significant higher (3.6-fold) IP-10 serum level than patient with single detection (P = 0.03; Table 4 ). A stratified analysis reveals that the highest IP-10 serum level was observed among patients with both several respiratory pathogens identified (mixed-detection group) and severe pneumonia (14,427 pg ml −1 , IQR (3,981-82,994). In detail, a remarkable IP-10 serum level (142,531 pg ml −1 ), representing 33-fold higher above cut-off value predicting pneumonia severity was observed in patient with hRV in NA co-detected with S. pneumoniae (serotype 14) in pleural effusion and blood. In concordance with our in-vitro model of co-infection, a significant IP-10 level (90,338 pg ml −1 ) was quantified in blood sample of patient with severe bacteremic pneumococcal (serotype 14) pneumonia with a positive co-detection of Influenza B virus in NA. Taken together, these results suggest that high serum IP-10 levels are significantly associated with mixed viral and bacterial detection and also related to pneumonia pathogenesis.\\n\\nThis study provides additional in vitro and clinical data to improve our understanding of the immunopathology of mixed viral and bacterial pneumonia (Fig. 4) .\\n\\nThe in vitro model of influenza and pneumococcal superinfection of human MDMs demonstrated that mixed infection synergistically induced release of the pro-inflammatory chemokine IP-10, strongly suggesting human Scientific RepoRts | 6:38532 | DOI: 10.1038/srep38532 blood leukocytes contribute to the immunopathology of pneumonia. Additionally, transcriptomics and omics analyses provided new data on the inflammatory pathways that are activated during mixed infection and related to synergistic induction of the pro-inflammatory chemokine IP-10 in mixed infected cells. Our observations are consistent with a recent study describing IP-10 induction as host-proteome signature of both viral and bacterial infections 30 . Of the differentially-expressed genes observed in mixed infected MDMs, the transcription factors STAT-1 and IRF-7 appear to play crucial roles in the regulation of interferon-stimulated genes including CXCL10 (IP-10). By focusing on the intracellular mechanisms that regulate inflammatory pathways, we demonstrated a novel role for miRNA-200a-3p in the regulation of CXCL10 (IP-10). These observations are consistent with previous reports showing that RNA virus infection upregulates miR-155 in macrophages and dendritic cells and also regulates suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1), suggesting the existence of a miRNA/JAK-STAT/SOCS regulatory pathway during viral infection 29 . Our study suggests co-infection leads to overexpression of miR-200a-3p, which in turn targets and downregulates the JAK-STAT regulator SOCS-6 and consequently increases CXCL10 (IP-10) expression. Interestingly, a complementary in-silico approach reveals that several microRNAs that were found dysregulated in our experiments of IAV and SP co-infection of MDMs or HAEC, might target several genes of SOCS family and play similar role than miR-200a-3p. Indeed, miRNA-142-3p might target SOCS4, 5, 6 mRNA while miRNA-194-5p might target SOCS2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 mRNA. These observations underline that intra-cellular regulation of IP-10 is not limited to the contribution of a sole microRNA. A complex inter-relationship between numerous host microRNAs and inhibitors of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway occur to control host innate inflammatory response against viral and/or bacterial infections. Clinically, the majority of pediatric CAP cases in this study were associated with both positive viral and/or bacterial detection. Respiratory microorganisms were detected in 97% of cases; 51.3% of which were viral-viral, viral-bacterial or bacterial-bacterial co-detected only in nasal aspirates, 32.4% of which co-detected in both nasal aspirates and blood samples. These data are consistent with previous etiological studies of pediatric CAP 3,31-33 . S. pneumoniae was the major bacteria identified in blood (19/74; 25.7%) and mainly co-detected with respiratory viruses in NAs (16/19; 84.2%). We observed a very high diversity of viral and bacterial associations in biological samples from children with pneumonia. In comparison with IAV and SP14 combination evaluated in-vitro, no pneumonia cases were singly influenza and pneumococcus infected, and no similar co-detection with those two pathogens has been clinically observed. Nevertheless, Influenza B (IVB) virus was identified in 5 patients and two of them had a positive SP co-detection in blood (one non-typable strain and one serotype 14 using our molecular typing test). IVB and SP14 combination seems to be the nearest pathogen co-detection to that in-vitro investigated. Clinically, this co-detection was associated with both a very high IP-10 expression and a very severe pneumonia case definition. Interestingly, our translational pilot evaluation reveals IP-10 expression can be induced by several different viral and/or bacterial combinations. As immune response to each pathogen is different, further in-vitro investigations using different pathogens associations are needed to better characterize the mechanisms involved in the immunopathology of pneumonia.\\n\\nIn this cohort, highest serum IP-10 levels were identified among patients with both several pathogen detected and severe pneumonia, suggesting a significant role of IP-10 on pneumonia pathogenesis. Indeed, high plasma levels of IP-10 have previously been reported in patients with sepsis 12 , and were associated with high mortality rate, especially among patients with CAP 34 . Additionally, the IP-10-CXCR3 axis has been related to acute immune lung injury and lymphocyte apoptosis during the development of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 35, 36 . Moreover, an in vivo study that modeled influenza and pneumococcal superinfection in mice indicated that pro-inflammatory chemokines, including IP-10, play a crucial role in influenza-induced susceptibility to lung neutrophilia, severe immunopathology and mortality 37 . In this study, markedly elevated IP-10 (92,809 pg ml −1 ) combined with the highest PCT level (74.4 pg ml −1 ) were quantified in the serum sample of a child who died, in whom S. pneumoniae (serotype 9 V) was identified in the blood (PCR and blood culture) and co-detected with Haemophilus influenzae type B in nasal aspirate. These observations suggest an interrelationship between co-detection, elevated serum IP-10 and the pathogenesis of pneumonia.\\n\\nSeveral limitations of this pilot translational study need to be acknowledged before concluding mixed infection is related to elevated IP-10 and disease severity. Indeed, although viral shedding (e.g., of HRV and HBoV) is common in asymptomatic children, we were unable to evaluate the levels of immunomodulators in the serum samples of a control group. Moreover, although the samples were collected within the first 24 hours after admission, only a single blood sample was processed for each patient. Therefore, a larger, longitudinal study on the etiology and severity of pneumonia will be necessary to confirm these results. In conclusion, the present findings suggest that mixed respiratory infections and IP-10 may play major, interconnected roles in the pathogenesis of pneumonia. Clinically, assessment and monitoring of induced IP-10 serum level may assist clinicians to improve diagnosis and patient management of severe community-acquired pneumonia.\\n\\nViral and bacterial strains. The 10 ng ml −1 M-CSF (Miltenyi Biotec). THP− 1 MDMs were obtained by culturing cells with 10 ng ml -1 phorbol myristate acetate (PMA; Invivogen, Toulouse, France) for 72 hours.

In this assay, fold changes have been defined by the Δ Δ Ct method using control RNU-44 and -48 as reference microRNAs. Total mRNA was purified from transfected and infected MDMs using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and specific primers were used to amplify transforming growth factor beta-2 (TGFB2; F: 5′ -CCATCCCGCCCACTTTCTAC-3′ , R: 5′ -AGCTCAATCCGTTGTTCAGGC-3′ ), SOCS6 (F: 5′ -AAGAATTCATCCCTTGGATTAGGTAAC-3′ , R: 5′ -CAGACTGGAGGTCGTGGAA-3′ ) 41 43 , and 3) absence of wheezing at auscultation, and, 4) first symptoms appearing within the last 14 days, and 5) radiological confirmation of pneumonia as per WHO guidelines 44 . Based on these primary criteria defining pneumonia cases, all 74 cases were retrospectively re-evaluated according to the WHO \"Pocket book of hospital care for children\" 45 criteria to evaluate pneumonia severity. Cases that died during the study, or who had at least one additional clinical signs including central cyanosis, dullness to percussion during chest examination, prostration/lethargy, pleural effusion observed on chest radiography were retrospectively included in the severe pneumonia group. Patients without any of these additional clinical signs were included in the non-severe pneumonia group. Table 4 . a IP-10 values are expressed in pg ml -1 .

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus was first recognized in September 2012 in Saudi Arabia. The clinical presentations of MERS and non-MERS SARI are often similar. Therefore, the identification of suspected cases that may have higher chances of being diagnosed as cases of MERS-CoV is essential. However, the real challenge is to flag these patients through some demographic markers. The nature of these markers has not previously been investigated in Saudi Arabia, and hence, this study aims to identify them. METHODS: It was a surveillance system-based study, for which data from a total of 23,646 suspected patients in Riyadh and Al Qassim regions were analyzed from January 2017 until December 2017 to estimate the prevalence of MERS-CoV among suspected cases and to determine potential demographic risk factors related to the confirmation of the diagnosis. RESULTS: Of 23,646 suspected cases, 119 (0.5%) were confirmed by laboratory results. These confirmed cases (67.2% of which were males) had a mean age of 43.23 years (SD ± 22.8). Around 42.2% of the confirmed cases were aged between 41 and 60 years and about 47% of confirmed cases had their suspected specimen tested in the summer. The study identified three significant and independent predictors for confirmation of the disease: an age between 41 and 60 years, male gender, and summer season admission. CONCLUSION: The study provides evidence that the MERS-CoV epidemic in the subject regions has specific characteristics that might help future plans for the prevention and management of such a contagious disease. Future studies should aim to confirm such findings in other regions of Saudi Arabia as well and explore potential preventable risk factors.\\n\\nText: A respiratory viral disease caused by the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus (MERS-CoV) was first isolated in 2012, in a 60-year-old man who died in Jeddah, KSA due to severe acute pneumonia and multiple organ failure [1] . Since then, 27 countries have reported the presence of this virus, including the 12 countries of the Eastern Mediterranean region. Several outbreaks have occurred in multiple countries including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and the Republic of Korea [2] . Recent fatality rate (CFR) of 21% [5, 6] . Very limited evidence is available for exploring the epidemiology of this virus among the pediatric population [7] . e literature shows that MERS-CoV infects males more than females [8, 9] . e casefatality rate of men (52%) is higher than that of women (23%) [10] . Males with a history of serious medical conditions are highly susceptible to this infection. Moreover, the mean age of infection in adults is 60 years [10] . e mode of transmission is not entirely understood yet [2] ; however, human-to-human [11] and zoonotic sources of transmission [12] have been documented in many studies. Dromedary camels are the major animal source of MERS-CoV transmission to humans. Interhuman transmission of the virus did not occur easily, but it is seen mainly in patients' families and healthcare settings [2] . Clinical pictures of this infection varied from asymptomatic to mild respiratory symptoms to severe respiratory distress and death [2] . Severe ailment can often cause respiratory catastrophes that need mechanical ventilation and support in ICUs across different healthcare settings [4] . Studies have suggested an incubation period of 16 days with a mean of 5-6 days [12, 13] , while the median time until death is 11-13 days (range 5-27 days) among severely ill patients [13] . e gold standard test for the detection of this virus is real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays [14] .\\n\\nere is no specific treatment for MERS-CoV. Like most viral infections, the treatment options are supportive and symptomatic [2] . At present, no vaccine exists for preventing the infections of MERS-CoV. e CDC indicated that preventative actions should be taken for any type of respiratory illness [4] . Such actions include washing hands with water and soap for around 20 seconds or using hand sanitizers with alcohol if no water is available. One must cover their nose and mouth during instances of sneezing and coughing with a tissue and avoid touching the mouth, nose, or eyes with their hands until washed properly. Repeatedly touched surfaces, such as door knobs, should be disinfected and cleaned regularly. Intimate personal contact, e.g., kissing, and sharing cups or eating utensils must also be avoided [15] .\\n\\nMany studies have been conducted in recent years in Saudi Arabia to combat this deadly disease. A large multicentre study showed that it is nearly impossible to differentiate between patients of MERS-CoV and non-MERS-CoV just on the basis of clinical presentation [16] . Another cohort study, which was hospital-based (17 cases vs. 82 controls), found that there were statistically significant differences in terms of gender, clinical, and radiographic presentations [17] . Similarly, two more single-centre case control studies reported that the presenting symptoms of MERS-CoV infection were not specific [18, 19] .\\n\\nPhysicians and public health practitioners need to identify suspected cases which have higher chances of diagnosis as confirmed cases prior to laboratory testing (which usually takes between 12 and 24 hours). Identification of a confirmed case is necessary to implement preventive strategies to combat the spread of the disease to family members and hospital healthcare workers [20] . Mild symptomatic cases, which result in a positive PCR, may be isolated at home. Severe to moderate cases should be admitted to and isolated in a hospital until they improve and then be discharged for isolation at home for an extended period. Both mild and severe cases are retested after 7 days, and the test is subsequently repeated after every 3 days until a negative result is obtained [20] .\\n\\nIdentifying suspected cases which may have higher chances of getting diagnosed as a confirmed case and implementing strict procedures on them might offer the best solution.\\n\\ne challenge is to flag these patients by some demographic markers, as the clinical presentation of MERS-CoV infected patients were non-specific. erefore, we aimed to identify some demographic markers specific to confirmed cases of MERS-CoV. e nature of these markers has not been investigated in Saudi Arabia, and hence this study aims to identify them.\\n\\nA cross-sectional study was conducted at the regional laboratory and blood bank, located at Shumaisi Hospital in Riyadh, KSA. e laboratory has received the Central Blood Banks and Reference Laboratories Accreditation Program Saudi Central Board for Accreditation of Healthcare Institution (CBAHI) 2018 [21] .\\n\\nTechnique. Data were collected during the period of January 2017 to December 2017. All patients in Riyadh and Al-Qassim regions who had their samples tested at Riyadh regional lab during the study period were considered as suspected cases.\\n\\ne study had two aims: descriptive and analytical. For the descriptive aim, we estimated the prevalence of MERS-CoV. For the analytical aim, a binary logistic regression model was developed. In this model, we included the risk factors of gender, age, seasons, nationality, healthcare status (yes/no), hospitals, and area of residence. Data were cross-checked with a labcomputerized database. Further data were collected on demographic characteristics (age and sex), underlying nationality, and health care status.\\n\\nWe collected data from 25,400 cases, of which 23,646 suspected cases of MERS-CoV were included in the final analysis. Data were cleaned, entered, stored, and managed with an excel database and IBM SPSS Version 25. e statistical analyses consisted of descriptive counts and percentages. For those continuously scaled items, nonparametric statistics (medians, interquartile ranges, minimum, and maximum) were used to describe the distribution. A logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of confirmation of infection within the suspected cases groups. At first, univariate analyses were conducted to estimate the unadjusted contribution and to determine the significant risk factors. is was followed by a multivariate logistic regression analysis to estimate the independent contribution of each covariate. To determine significant factors, a p value below 0.05 and a 95% confidence interval were considered. \\n\\nA confirmed case is defined as a suspected case with laboratory confirmation of MERS-CoV infection [20] . \\n\\nA total of 23,646 of MERS-CoV suspected cases were included in this study, of which 52.3% were males (n � 12376) and 47.7% were females (n � 11270). e age of individuals with suspected cases ranged between 0 to 92 years with a mean age of 43. 23 e adjusted odds of MERS-CoV remained significant among different age groups; the odds of patients aged between 20-40 years increased threefold (A.OR: 3.11, 95% CI: 1.104-8.76, P value � 0.032), whereas in the age group of 41-60 years, it increased further to a risk that was six times higher \\n\\nis cross-sectional study about the epidemiological analysis of MERS-CoV infection laboratory-based data was conducted in Riyadh over a one-year period (2017). A total of 23,646 suspected cases were included in the results. Of the total suspected cases, 119 cases had been confirmed via laboratory results. All the confirmed cases are reported to MOH through HESN (health electronic surveillance networks) and to the World Health Organization (WHO) through the International Health Regulations (IHR), National Focal Point of Saudi Arabia. We found that MERS-CoV infection was found significantly in people aged between 41 and 60 years and was reported most commonly during the summer season. e odds of infection among males were found to be twice as high as that of females with suspected cases.\\n\\nDuring the study period, i.e., the year 2017, only 119 confirmed cases were reported, which means that the number of MERS-CoV infection cases has decreased in Riyadh and Al-Qassim regions in comparison to that of the last three years. From 2015 to 2016, there was a 25.4% decrease, whereas from 2016 to 2017, it decreased by 48.7%, which translates into a 50% decrease between the two periods. is also complements the findings reported by of Da'ar and Ahmed in their paper [23] . e predominance of infection in males was also observed in another study pwefromed in KSA (2015), which reported the percentage of confirmed cases among males to be 66%, compared with 34% among females [24] .\\n\\nIt is worth mentioning that Saudi Arabia defines age categories differently from the WHO (children: 0-14, adult: otherwise) [20] . However, unlike the classification used in Saudi Arabia, we have followed the WHO categorization of age to differentiate between children/adolescents (0 to 19 years) and adults (20 years and older) as indicated in WHO reports for age-standardized population and in infectious diseases [25] . is categorization was also followed by Aly and his collaborators in their recent paper published in 2017 [14] . Adults were further subcategorized into three groups according to the age distribution of the study population using the following two cutoff points (age of 41 and age of 60) [14] .\\n\\nese data agreed with a previous surveillance study, which stated that the majority of confirmed cases of MERS-CoV were reported among people aged 40 and above [24] . In 2016, only 9 of 552 cases (1.6%) of MERS-CoV infection were found among pediatric patients. Moreover, the study which was conducted in King Fahad Medical City in Riyadh (KFMC) between January 2012 and December 2013 did not report any MERS-CoV cases among children [26] . e study which was conducted across the Gulf countries for four years by Mahmoud Aly et al. between 2012 and 2016 suggests that the prevalence and distribution of MERS-CoV were the highest-risk in elderly aged 60 years or above [14] . Similar to our results, this study also reported the highest number of confirmed cases during the summer season [14] .\\n\\nAmong confirmed cases, only 25.2% were healthcare workers, whereas around 75% were non-healthcare workers.\\n\\nis is in agreement with the study done by Ahmad to estimate the survival rate in MERS-CoV globally prior to 26 January 2017; 86.9% were not health-care workers compared with 13.1% confirmed cases of healthcare workers [27] . Similarly, other studies also reported a lower prevalence in healthcare workers [28] [29] [30] .\\n\\nOur data reported a higher prevalence of infection among Saudi nationals as compared with non-Saudi. Another study also showed similar results but with a much higher percentage among Saudis, which may be due to the fact that it included Saudis from all regions [29] . ere is no finding basis for comparison as such, because our study was focused on the Riyadh and Al Qassim regions only.\\n\\nIn our study, we detected a low prevalence (0.5%). e low positive predictive value of our lab results is not related to the low sensitivity and specificity of the lab assay. e estimated analytical sensitivity and specificity of the Real Star kit from Altona was reported to be 100% with no cross reactivity with other respiratory pathogens [31] . Moreover, this low predictive value in the lab results is related to the high burden of false positive cases referred to the lab. In fact, this research is just the starting point to shed the light on more factors that might help in putting more descriptive criteria to lower the financial and human resources burden.\\n\\nTo the best of our knowledge, no one has developed a logistic regression that focuses on demographic risk factors such as sex, age, and seasons prior to our study. However, it is worth mentioning that Ahmed et al. developed a risk prediction model that encompasses risk factors such as chest pain, leukopenia, and elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) [21] . However, further investigations are needed to confirm our findings.\\n\\nOne of the major strengths of our study is that it is a comprehensive regional study which included all the suspected cases of MERS-CoV in the Riyadh and Al-Qassim regions. Secondly, the external validity of our study is also expected to be high, as it covers the two regions completely, meaning that the records of all suspected cases in these two main regions in Saudi Arabia were included. irdly, the quality of the data is considered to be high, given that the contagious and life-threatening nature of this disease has led to strict obedience to rules which are enforced in a timely manner, thus ensuring accurate reporting of suspected cases. In addition to this, quality assurance policies are implemented at HESN in order to maintain the highest level of validity and reliability of the data collection process. e variables available for suspected cases were limited to demographics, which limited the scope of our research, but they provided valuable information to form a basis for future studies of a broader scope. Variables such as primary/secondary infections are vital pieces of information, but due the limitation of the data available, we could not determine their effects.\\n\\nAccording to our knowledge, this is one of the few studies that have specifically investigated MERS-CoV risk factors in the Riyadh and Al-Qassim areas (two major regions in KSA). Given that all suspected and confirmed cases were included in this study, we assume that our results are generalizable for both the regions with confidence. It must be noted that the comparative group of this study is different from that of the previous ones, as we compared those with confirmed MERS-CoV with those with suspected MERS-CoV who have passed all stages of screening at the hospital, whereas other studies were hospital but not lab-based with an aim of identifying factors that help in suspecting rather than confirming cases. is might be the reason why we have found some significant demographic factors unlike other reports.\\n\\nIn conclusion, this research is about predictors for the confirmation of diagnosis among suspected cases only, meaning that the factors we found can help in identifying suspected cases that may have a higher chance of testing positive. is will help primary healthcare professionals to develop a better screening tool for suspected cases, as currently only a small minority of suspected cases are confirmed positive via lab results, consequently resulting in a lot of resources being spent to test thousands of samples, just for the identification of a few cases. e three factors we identified are important because, for example, a female, aged 18, presenting in winter will be less likely to be diagnosed than a male, aged 45, presenting in the summer, or, to give another example, a 60-year-old male who is presenting MERS-CoV signs with a negative lab result may need retesting.\\n\\nOur study covered two main regions in Saudi Arabia and provides evidence that the MERS-CoV epidemic in these two regions has specific characteristics that might help future plans for prevention and management of such contagious diseases. Our results showed that only a minority of suspected cases are actually diagnosed with the disease, meaning that the procedures being implemented seemed to be highly sensitive but not highly specific. e majority of confirmed cases were male, aged 41 to 60 years, and presented to healthcare facilities in the summer. Future studies should aim to confirm such findings in other regions in Saudi Arabia, to explore potential preventable risk factors and go deeper to know the underlying factors that make male aged 41-60 more susceptible than others.\\n\\ne laboratory data used to support the findings of this study were provided by Riyadh Regional Laboratory under license and are not freely available.

The inconsistency might be due to inaccurate identification of cases of infection and different methods of categorizing service volumes. This study takes coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgical site infections (SSIs) as an example to examine whether a relationship exists between operation volumes and SSIs, when different SSIs case identification, definitions and categorization methods of operation volumes were implemented. METHODS: A population-based cross-sectional multilevel study was conducted. A total of 7,007 patients who received CABG surgery between 2006 and 2008 from19 medical centers in Taiwan were recruited. SSIs associated with CABG surgery were identified using International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9 CM) codes and a Classification and Regression Trees (CART) model. Two definitions of surgeon and hospital operation volumes were used: (1) the cumulative CABG operation volumes within the study period; and (2) the cumulative CABG operation volumes in the previous one year before each CABG surgery. Operation volumes were further treated in three different ways: (1) a continuous variable; (2) a categorical variable based on the quartile; and (3) a data-driven categorical variable based on k-means clustering algorithm. Furthermore, subgroup analysis for comorbidities was also conducted. RESULTS: This study showed that hospital volumes were not significantly associated with SSIs, no matter which definitions or categorization methods of operation volume, or SSIs case identification approaches were used. On the contrary, the relationships between surgeon’s volumes varied. Most of the models demonstrated that the low-volume surgeons had higher risk than high-volume surgeons. CONCLUSION: Surgeon volumes were more important than hospital volumes in exploring the relationship between CABG operation volumes and SSIs in Taiwan. However, the relationships were not robust. Definitions and categorization methods of operation volume and correct identification of SSIs are important issues for future research.\\n\\nText: data, which should use hierarchical models, may result in biased estimation of the variation and also lead to incorrect conclusions.\\n\\nSSIs following coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) procedures place a heavy burden on patients and healthcare systems. The total length of stay and expenditure for patients with SSIs after CABG surgery is significantly longer and higher than those without SSIs. [20, 21] In 2008, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid of the United States of America implemented the \"Never Event\" policy, where hospitals would no longer receive higher payments for the additional costs associated with treating patients for certain healthcare-acquired infections, including those related to CABG.\\n\\nIn view of the accuracy of SSIs identification and the heterogeneity of definition and categorization methods, no existing studies have used different infection case identification nor definitions and categorization methods of operation volume simultaneously to explore the relationship between operation volumes and infection. The current study takes CABG SSIs as an example to examine whether a relationship exists between operation volumes and SSIs, given different SSI cases identification, operation volume definitions and categorization methods.\\n\\nThis retrospective and cross-sectional study adopted a multilevel design to examine the relationships between provider volumes and SSIs after adjusting for patient-, surgeon-, and hospital-level covariates.\\n\\nWe used data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) from 2005 and 2008. The NHIRD, published by the Taiwan National Health Research Institute, includes all the original claims data and registration files for beneficiaries enrolled under the National Health Insurance (NHI) program. The database covers the 23 million Taiwanese enrollees (approximately 98% of the population) in the NHI program. It is a de-identified secondary database containing patient-level demographic and administrative information; however, treatment items are aggregated and without time-related and clinical information. The data is released for research purposes.\\n\\nThe protocol for the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the National Taiwan University Hospital (protocol #201001027R). The dataset we used in this study was secondary data; all information was de-identified by data owners.\\n\\nIn this study, we adopted the ICD-9-CM SSI codes (hereafter referred to as the ICD-9-CM based model) and the Classification and Regression Trees (CART) model, which was developed in our previous work [11] to identify SSI cases. As we mentioned above, the ICD-9-CM SSI codes were the most popular tool to identify the SSI cases in claims data. In the ICD-9-CM based model, SSI cases were divided into two categories: index hospitalization events and post-discharge events (i.e., SSIs that occurred within 1 year after discharge and required readmission to a hospital and/ or the use of ambulatory services). Following Wu et al [13] , this study adopted the secondary ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes for index hospitalization events (ICD-9-CM code: 996.03, 996.61, 996.72, and 998.5), and the primary and secondary diagnosis codes for post-discharge events (ICD-9-CM code: 038.0-038. 4 ) as the criteria for SSI identification, in order to avoid cases in which infection existed prior to hospitalization. If a case had an index hospitalization event or a post-discharge event, then he/ she will be identified as SSIs by the ICD-9-CM based model. In the CART model, we adopted the type of antibiotics, dose of cefazolin, length of stay, and number of vessels obstructed (as a proxy indicator of duration of operation) as the parameters to identify the SSIs, according to our previous findings. [11] In our previous work, we used the 2005-2008 National Health Insurance claims data and healthcare-associated infection surveillance data from two medical centers for model development and model verification. Infection cases based on surveillance were identified by infection control personnel if the patient met the Taiwan CDC\\'s criteria, which are the same as those adopted in the U.S. CDC. They manually review medical records of all patients at risk for the specified healthcare-associated infection.\\n\\nThe classification algorithms, the multivariable regression model, and the data mining model were adopted to develop alternative models based on surrogate indicators to identify cases of CABG SSIs and to compare the performance among these models and the ICD-9-CMbased model. For the classification algorithms, researchers build up several criteria, and if a case satisfies (or exceeds) a specific number of criteria, then it will be identified as a case of infection. For the multivariable regression model, researchers usually calculated a risk score by the logistic regression model, and the optimal cutoff point was determined according to the resulting receiver operating characteristic curve.\\n\\nConcerning the data mining approach, which is widely used for predicting and classifying objects, the characteristics are: automatic discovery of patterns, prediction of likely outcomes, creation of actionable information, and focus on large data sets and databases. The classification and regression tree (CART) model, which is the most popular approach as applied in our work, and the growing, stopping, and pruning of the tree were determined by Gini improvement measures. [22, 23] After referring to the literature and conferring with infectious disease specialists, we adopted the following seven parameters: type of antibiotic, doses of antibiotic, doses of cefazolin, use of second-line antibiotics, length of stay, and number of vessels obstructed. Additionally, cross-validation was also employed, where data from one medical center was used for model development, and another one was used for model validation.\\n\\nThe results of our previous work revealed that the CART model offered better performance than that of the other identification models or the ICD-9-CM based model, especially in the positive predictive value (>70%), which was only found to be 20% in the ICD-9-CM based model. (Table 1 ) The findings also implied that the CART was a decidedly better tool for identifying cases of SSI in the Taiwan National Health Insurance database. Therefore, this study also adopted the CART model for identifying CABG SSIs.\\n\\nTo ensure homogeneity, current study analyzed 7,007 patients from 19 medical centers in Taiwan who underwent CABG surgery (ICD-9-CM procedure codes 36.1x-36.2x) between 2006 and 2008. CABG patients under the age of 18 years or over 85 years were excluded in this study. A total of 302 cases were identified as SSIs by ICD-9-CM based model, and a total of 107 cases were identified as SSIs by CART model.\\n\\nIn this study, we used the following two definitions to define operation volumes: (1) the cumulative operation volumes by each surgeon and hospital within the study period, which was the most common definition in the literature; and (2) following Yasunaga et al.\\'s study, [24] cumulative operation volumes by each surgeon and hospital in the previous one year for each surgery. However, our data was skewed, which did not follow a normal distribution. Therefore, we conducted the log transformations on operation volumes.\\n\\nThe current work treated operation volumes in three different ways: (1) a continuous variable; (2) a categorical variable based on the first and the third quartile as cutoff points (the most common method to categorize service/ operation volumes) [25] [26] [27] [28] ; and (3) a data-driven categorical variable based on k-means clustering algorithm. This study categorized surgeon and hospital volumes into low, medium, and high volume groups by quartile method and kmeans clustering algorithm.\\n\\nIn the quartile method, the cut-off value (transformed by logarithm) of the first quartile (<25%) for hospital volumes was 5.65, and the third quartile (>75%) was 6.43. In terms of surgeon volumes, the first quartile was 4.38, and the third was 5.35, when we used the cumulative operation volumes within the study period as the definition. While the definition changed, first quartile (<25%) for hospital volumes was 4.66, and the third quartile (>75%) was 5.31. In terms of surgeon volumes, the first quartile was 3.40, and the third was 4.32.\\n\\nK-means clustering is an unsupervised machine-learning algorithm introduced by MacQueen in 1960s. This method is not only a simple and very reliable method in categorization/ classification, but is also recognized as one of the top 10 algorithms in data mining. [29] This method has often been applied in many fields. [30] [31] [32] Yu and his colleagues even applied it to define the quality of CABG care, and to explore the relationship among patient\\'s income status, the level of quality of care, and inpatient mortality. [33] The main idea of this method is to partition observed data points into k non-overlapping clusters by minimizing the within-group sum of squares. Each point is assigned to the mean of its cluster using the Euclidian distance. Firstly, k cluster centers were randomly generated. Previous studies usually divided surgeons and hospitals into low-, medium-, and high-volume groups; therefore, we also predetermined the surgeon and hospital service volumes into 3 groups (k = 3). Then, participants were assigned to the cluster with the shortest distance to these cluster centers. Finally, the cluster centers were recomputed using the new cluster assignment and these steps would be iterated until convergence was achieved. [34] The cut-off values of hospital volumes were 5.21 and 5.69, and for surgeon\\'s volumes were 2.40 and 4.38 respectively, when cumulative operation volumes within the study period was used as the definition. Likewise, when cumulative operation volumes before each surgery was used as definition, the cut-off values were 4.11 and 4.89 for hospital volumes, and 2.64 and 3.91 for surgeon\\'s volumes. All cutoff values were transformed by logarithm. The results of k-means clustering are demonstrated in Figs 1-4. As the results show, the operation volumes were divided into three groups separately. In addition to surgeon and hospital volumes and SSI, we collected patient-, surgeon-, and hospital-level data. Firstly, patient-level variables included age, gender, length of ICU stay, number of vessels obstructed that were involved in the surgical operation, and the presence of important underlying diseases (e.g. diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart failure, renal failure and renal insufficiency, which were associated with SSI).\\n\\n[13] Secondly, the surgeon-level variables included age and gender. Thirdly, the hospital-level variables included hospital ownership and geographic location.\\n\\nAll statistical analyses of volume-infection relationship were performed using SAS (version 9.2, SAS Institution Inc., Cary, NC, USA). In statistical testing, a two-sided p value 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The distributional properties of continuous variables were expressed by mean ± standard deviation (SD), whereas categorical variables were presented by frequency and percentage. In univariate analysis, the potential three-level predictors of SSI were examined using chi-square test or two-sample t-test as appropriate. Next, to account for the correlations within surgeon (level-2) and hospital (level-3), multivariate analysis was conducted by fitting mixed-effects logistic regression models to each patient\\'s data for estimating the effects of three-level predictors on the probability of post-operational SSI. Furthermore, subgroup analysis for comorbidities was also conducted. Table 2 shows that there were 7,007 patients with CABG performed by 199 surgeons in 19 hospitals during 2006-2008 in Taiwan. The majority of patients were male (77.5%), and the mean age of patients was 65.3 years. The average ICU stay was 6.05 days, the mean level of number of vessels obstructed was around 1.6, while 51.8% of patients had diabetes mellitus, 33.3% had heart failure, 14.1% had renal failure and renal insufficiency, and 22.0% had COPD. Three hundred and two patients (4.31%) were identified as having the ICD-9-CM SSI codes. However, identification by the CART model only revealed 107 infection cases, and 94 cases were identified in both models. Most cases received CABG surgery by male surgeons, with a mean age of 45.0 years, and the surgeon\\'s average operation volumes within the study period was 151.64, while the average operation volumes before surgery was 52.18. More than half of the cases were performed with CABG in not-for-profit hospitals, and the hospitals\\' average operation volumes within the study period was 473.60, while the average operation volumes before each surgery was 158.79. Moreover, most of patients received their surgeries by high-volume surgeons and hospitals, when k-means algorithm was used for categorization, regardless of which definition of operation volumes were used. Table 3 shows the results of multilevel mixed-effect models, with the SSIs being identified by ICD-9-CM codes, and the operation volumes defined as the cumulative volumes within the study period. The results of Model 1 (continuous) reveal that the surgeon\\'s volumes were negatively associated with SSIs, while hospital\\'s volumes were not associated with surgical site infection SSIs. Model 2 (quartile) suggests that low-volume surgeons had higher SSI risk (OR = 2.220, p-value = 0.022) than high-volume surgeons. There were also no associations between hospital\\'s operation volumes and SSIs. Model 3 (k-means) shows that the association did not exist between hospital\\'s/ surgeon\\'s volumes and SSIs. Table 4 displays the results of multilevel mixed-effect models, in which the SSIs were identified by the CART model, and the operation volumes were also defined as the cumulative volumes within the study period. Model 1 again indicated a negative association between surgeon\\'s volumes and SSIs, and hospital\\'s volumes were not found to be associated with SSIs. In Model 2, the results showed that the relationship between hospital\\'s/ surgeon\\'s volumes and SSIs did not exist. In Model 3, results revealed low-volume surgeons had higher risk (OR = 1.691, p = 0.002) than high-volume surgeons. Table 5 displays the results of multilevel mixed-effect models, in which the SSIs were identified by ICD-9-CM codes, but the operation volumes were defined as the cumulative volume in the previous one year for each surgery. Model 1 also indicated a negative association between surgeon\\'s volumes and SSIs, and hospital\\'s volumes were not found to be associated with SSIs. In Model 2, the results showed that the relationship between hospital\\'s/ surgeon\\'s volumes and SSIs did not exist. In Model 3, results also revealed low-volume surgeons had higher risk (OR = 1.642, p = 0.040) than high-volume surgeons. Table 6 displays the results of multilevel mixed-effect models, in which the SSIs were identified by the CART model, and the operation volumes were also defined as the cumulative volume in previous one year for each surgery. In Model 1, different to the above findings, there was no association between hospital\\'s/ surgeon\\'s volumes and SSIs. In Model 2, the results showed that the relationship between hospital\\'s/ surgeon\\'s volumes and SSIs did not exist. In Model 3, results also revealed low-volume surgeons had higher risk (OR = 1.163, p = 0.020) than high-volume surgeons.\\n\\nWe further examined the associations of surgeon and hospital volumes with SSIs in stratification analyses by underlying diseases. When the operation volumes were defined as the cumulative operation volume within the study period, no relationships existed between hospital/ surgeon operation volumes and SSIs. (Table 7 ) However, when the operation volumes were defined as the cumulative operation volumes in the previous one year for each surgery, the results suggested that there was a negative association between surgeon volumes and SSIs in the diabetes group, except that the volumes were treated as continuous variable and the infection cases were identified by ICD-9 codes. In terms of hospital operation volumes, the association did not exist. (Table 8 ) \\n\\nNo studies have evaluated how different service/ operation volumes definitions and categorization methods affect volume-infection relationships. Moreover, several studies have pointed out the inappropriateness of identifying infection cases using the ICD-9-CM codes in claims data. Given these reasons, this study adopted two approaches to identifying SSIs, two definitions of operation volumes, and three methods for categorizing operation volumes to examine the relationships between operation volumes and SSIs. Our findings showed that the relationships between hospital volumes and SSIs did not exist, no matter which definitions, categorization mehods, or SSIs case identification approaches were used. On the contrary, the relationships between surgeon volumes and SSIs were not robust in our data. It might be affected by different definitions and categorization methods of operation volumes, and also by different SSI cases identification approaches. In summary, most of the models demonstrated that the low-volume surgeons had higher risk than high-volume surgeons, and they also showed the risks were similar between medium-volume and high-volume surgeons. However, why did surgeon volume relate to SSIs, but hospital volume did not? Except for those issues we were concerned about in this study, there are some disagreements in the literature. Such as \"Does provider volume really represent quality of care?\" [12, 35] Or \"Is provider volume the only one predictor for outcome of care?\" [35, 36] These issues are worthy of further discussion, but are out of the scope of this study.\\n\\nService/ operation volumes are treated as a proxy indicator for experiences; previous studies used it to examine whether practice makes perfect or not. But, except for provider\\'s experiences, SSIs are also impacted by many factors, such as environmental and clinical factors. Wu et al once used Taiwan 2001 NHI claims data to explore the relationship between provider CABG operation volumes and SSIs. [13] They found that hospital volumes had a greater effect than surgeon volumes and claimed that this may imply that hospital teamwork is more important than individual surgeon. However, our findings demonstrated that there was no relationship between hospital volumes and SSIs. Wu et al. adopted the cumulative operation volumes within the study period as the definition, and identified SSIs by ICD-9-CM codes. Except, there were two differences between our work and Wu et al., which were the length and year of the data; our data was longer and more updated than theirs. Moreover, it is worth noting that there was an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Taiwan in 2003, after which the hospital infection control system in Taiwan was reviewed and re-designed. Wu et al data was before SARS, so these efforts may also have improved the level of SSIs control in hospitals, leading to different findings in this study.\\n\\nIn addition, although most models revealed that there were negative relationships between surgeon\\'s volumes and surgical site infection, the relationships were not robust. The results varied between different definitions and categorization method of operation volumes, and between SSIs identification approaches. Researchers need to consider how to identify SSIs correctly, how to choose optimal cut-off values, and how to decide on which definition is appropriate.\\n\\nFinally, the results of stratification analyses showed that low-volume surgeon had higher risk than high-volume surgeon in the diabetes mellitus group, when the cumulative operation in the previous one year before surgery was used as definition. A large number of studies have indicated diabetes mellitus is associated with a higher risk of SSIs, [37] [38] [39] and the findings of this study suggest that CABG patients with diabetes mellitus should be cared for by experienced surgeons.\\n\\nA multilevel analysis was applied to manage the nested factors, and two definitions of operation volume along with three different operation volume categorization methods were adopted to examine the relationship between volume and SSIs under two kinds of SSIs identification approaches. Nevertheless, the study suffered from several major limitations. First, the accuracy of SSIs identification was still an issue. Although the performance of the CART model to identify CABG SSIs was better than ICD-9-CM codes in Taiwan NHI claims data, it did not reach the perfect scenario. The accuracy of SSIs identification was still a challenge in our work. The second limitation relates to unmeasured variables, such as length of stay before operation, infection condition, hair removal, clinical information (e.g. blood glucose level, causative microorganism), time-related information (e.g. the duration of operation), the environment, surgical skills, use of post-operative drains, number of operations involved, and surgical site and wound care, etc. [40] Furthermore, information about type (elective or urgent) and incision site for surgery was not available in the Taiwan NHI claims data.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the findings of this study suggest that different definitions and categorization methods of operation volumes, and different SSIs identification approaches might lead to different findings, although surgeon volumes were more important than hospital volumes in exploring the relationships between CABG operation volumes and SSIs in Taiwan, but they were still not robust. Definitions and categorization methods of operation volumes, and correct identification of SSIs are important issues for future research.'}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '6184a5e6fc08626eb6d3843274e46f9d'}>,\n",

OBJECTIVE: To assess the magnitude of mental health outcomes and associated factors among health care workers treating patients exposed to COVID-19 in China. DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional, survey-based, region-stratified study collected demographic data and mental health measurements from 1257 health care workers in 34 hospitals from January 29, 2020, to February 3, 2020, in China. Health care workers in hospitals equipped with fever clinics or wards for patients with COVID-19 were eligible. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The degree of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress was assessed by the Chinese versions of the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, the 7-item Insomnia Severity Index, and the 22-item Impact of Event Scale–Revised, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with mental health outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 1257 of 1830 contacted individuals completed the survey, with a participation rate of 68.7%. A total of 813 (64.7%) were aged 26 to 40 years, and 964 (76.7%) were women. Of all participants, 764 (60.8%) were nurses, and 493 (39.2%) were physicians; 760 (60.5%) worked in hospitals in Wuhan, and 522 (41.5%) were frontline health care workers. A considerable proportion of participants reported symptoms of depression (634 [50.4%]), anxiety (560 [44.6%]), insomnia (427 [34.0%]), and distress (899 [71.5%]). Nurses, women, frontline health care workers, and those working in Wuhan, China, reported more severe degrees of all measurements of mental health symptoms than other health care workers (eg, median [IQR] Patient Health Questionnaire scores among physicians vs nurses: 4.0 [1.0-7.0] vs 5.0 [2.0-8.0]; P = .007; median [interquartile range {IQR}] Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale scores among men vs women: 2.0 [0-6.0] vs 4.0 [1.0-7.0]; P < .001; median [IQR] Insomnia Severity Index scores among frontline vs second-line workers: 6.0 [2.0-11.0] vs 4.0 [1.0-8.0]; P < .001; median [IQR] Impact of Event Scale–Revised scores among those in Wuhan vs those in Hubei outside Wuhan and those outside Hubei: 21.0 [8.5-34.5] vs 18.0 [6.0-28.0] in Hubei outside Wuhan and 15.0 [4.0-26.0] outside Hubei; P < .001). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed participants from outside Hubei province were associated with lower risk of experiencing symptoms of distress compared with those in Wuhan (odds ratio [OR], 0.62; 95% CI, 0.43-0.88; P = .008). Frontline health care workers engaged in direct diagnosis, treatment, and care of patients with COVID-19 were associated with a higher risk of symptoms of depression (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.11-2.09; P = .01), anxiety (OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.22-2.02; P < .001), insomnia (OR, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.92-4.60; P < .001), and distress (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.25-2.04; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this survey of heath care workers in hospitals equipped with fever clinics or wards for patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan and other regions in China, participants reported experiencing psychological burden, especially nurses, women, those in Wuhan, and frontline health care workers directly engaged in the diagnosis, treatment, and care for patients with COVID-19.\\n\\nText: Abbreviation: PHQ-9, 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire; GAD-7, 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder; ISI, 7-item Insomnia Severity Index; IES-R, 22-item Impact of Event Abbreviation: IES-R, 22-item Impact of Event Scale-Revised; IQR, interquartile range.

Over the last 20 years, there has been a substantial decrease in the incidence of childhood pneumonia and pneumonia-associated mortality. New conjugate vaccines against Haemophilus influenzae type b and Streptococcus pneumoniae have contributed to decreases in radiologic, clinical and complicated pneumonia cases and have reduced hospitalization and mortality. The importance of co-infections with multiple pathogens and the predominance of viral-associated disease are emerging. Better access to effective preventative and management strategies is needed in low- and middle-income countries, while new strategies are needed to address the residual burden of disease once these have been implemented.\\n\\nText: Pneumonia has been the leading cause of death in children younger than 5 years for decades. Although there have been substantial decreases in overall child mortality and in pneumonia-specific mortality, pneumonia remains the major single cause of death in children outside the neonatal period, causing approximately 900,000 of the estimated 6.3 million child deaths in 2013 [1] . Substantial advances have occurred in the understanding of risk factors and etiology of pneumonia, in development of standardized case definitions, and in prevention with the production of improved vaccines and in treatment. Such advances have led to changes in the epidemiology, etiology and mortality from childhood pneumonia. However in many areas access to these interventions remains sub-optimal, with large inequities between and within countries and regions. In this paper we review the impact of recent preventative and management advances in pneumonia epidemiology, etiology, radiologic presentation and outcome in children.\\n\\nThe overall burden of childhood pneumonia has been reduced substantially over the last decade, despite an increase in the global childhood population from 605 million in 2000 to 664 million in 2015 [2] . Recent data suggest that there has been a 25% decrease in the incidence of pneumonia, from 0.29 episodes per child year in low-and middle-income countries in 2000, to 0.22 episodes per child year in 2010 [3] . This is substantiated by a 58% decrease in pneumonia-associated disability-adjusted life years between 1990 and 2013, from 186 million to 78 million as estimated in the Global Burden of Disease study [1] . Pneumonia deaths decreased from 1.8 million in 2000 to 900,000 in 2013 [1] . These data do not reflect the full impact of increasingly widespread use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in low-and middle-income countries because the incidence of pneumonia and number of deaths are likely to decrease still further as a result of this widespread intervention [4] .\\n\\nNotwithstanding this progress, there remains a disproportionate burden of disease in low-and middle-income countries, where more than 90% of pneumonia cases and deaths occur. The incidence in high-income countries is estimated at 0.015 episodes per child year, compared to 0.22 episodes per child year in low-and middle-income countries [3] . On average, 1 in 66 children in high-income countries is affected by pneumonia per year, compared to 1 in 5 children in low-and middle-income countries. Even within low-and middleincome countries there are regional inequities and challenges with access to health care services: up to 81% of severe pneumonia deaths occur outside a hospital [5] . In addition to a higher incidence of pneumonia, the case fatality rate is estimated to be almost 10-fold higher in low-and middle-income countries as compared to high-income countries [3, 5] .\\n\\nChildhood pneumonia can also lead to significant morbidity and chronic disease. Early life pneumonia can impair longterm lung health by decreasing lung function [6] . Severe or recurrent pneumonia can have a worse effect on lung function; increasing evidence suggests that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease might be related to early childhood pneumonia [7, 8] . A meta-analysis of the risk of long-term outcomes after childhood pneumonia categorized chronic respiratory sequelae into major (restrictive lung disease, obstructive lung disease, bronchiectasis) and minor (chronic bronchitis, asthma, abnormal pulmonary function) groups [9] . The risk of developing at least one of the major sequelae was estimated as 6% after an ambulatory pneumonia event and 14% after an episode of hospitalized pneumonia. Because respiratory diseases affect almost 1 billion people globally and are a major cause of mortality and morbidity [10] , childhood pneumonia might contribute to substantial morbidity across the life course.\\n\\nChest radiologic changes have been considered the gold standard for defining a pneumonia event [11] because clinical findings can be subjective and clinical definitions of pneumonia can be nonspecific. In 2005, to aid in defining outcomes of pneumococcal vaccine studies, the World Health Organization\\'s (WHO) standardized chest radiograph description defined a group of children who were considered most likely to have pneumococcal pneumonia [12] . The term \"end-point consolidation\" was described as a dense or fluffy opacity that occupies a portion or whole of a lobe, or the entire lung. \"Other infiltrate\" included linear and patchy densities, peribronchial thickening, minor patchy infiltrates that are not of sufficient magnitude to constitute primary end-point consolidation, and small areas of atelectasis that in children can be difficult to distinguish from consolidation. \"Primary end-point pneumonia\" included either end-point consolidation or a pleural effusion associated with a pulmonary parenchymal infiltrate (including \"other\" infiltrate).\\n\\nWidespread use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination and Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccination has decreased the incidence of radiologic pneumonia. In a review of four randomized controlled trials and two case-control studies of Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccination in high-burden communities, the vaccination was associated with an 18% decrease in radiologic pneumonia [13] . Introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination was associated with a 26% decrease in radiologic pneumonia in California between 1995 and 1998 [14] . In vaccine efficacy trials in low-and middle-income countries, pneumococcal conjugate vaccination reduced radiologic pneumonia by 37% in the Gambia [15] , 25% in South Africa [16] and 26% in the Philippines [17] .\\n\\nThe WHO radiologic case definition was not intended to distinguish bacterial from viral etiology but rather to define a sub-set of pneumonia cases in which pneumococcal infection was considered more likely and to provide a set of standardized definitions through which researchers could achieve broad agreement in reporting chest radiographs. However, despite widespread field utilization, there are concerns regarding inter-observer repeatability. There has been good consensus for the description of lobar consolidation but significant disagreement on the description of patchy and perihilar infiltrates [18, 19] . In addition, many children with clinically severe lung disease do not have primary end-point pneumonia: in one pre-pneumococcal conjugate vaccination study, only 34% of children hospitalized with pneumonia had primary end-point pneumonia [20] . A revised case definition of \"presumed bacterial pneumonia\" has been introduced, and this definition includes pneumonia cases with WHO-defined alveolar consolidation, as well as those with other abnormal chest radiograph infiltrates and a serum C-reactive protein of at least 40 mg/L [21, 22] . This definition has been shown to have greater sensitivity than the original WHO radiologic definition of primary end-point pneumonia for detecting the burden of pneumonia prevented by pneumococcal conjugate vaccination [23] . Using the revised definition, the 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-10), had a vaccine efficacy of 22% in preventing presumed bacterial pneumonia in young children in South America [22] , and pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-13 had a vaccine efficacy of 39% in preventing presumed bacterial pneumonia in children older than 16 weeks who were not infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in South Africa [21] . Thus there is convincing evidence that pneumococcal conjugate vaccination decreases the incidence of radiologic pneumonia; however there is no evidence to suggest that pneumococcal conjugate vaccination modifies the radiologic appearance of pneumococcal pneumonia.\\n\\nEmpyema is a rare complication of pneumonia. An increased incidence of empyema in children was noted in some high-income countries following pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7 introduction, and this was attributed to pneumococcal serotypes not included in pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7, especially 3 and 19A [24] . In the United States, evidence from a national hospital database suggests that the incidence of empyema increased 1.9-fold between 1996 and 2008 [25] . In Australia, the incidence rate ratio increased by 1.4 times when comparing the pre-pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7 period (1998 to 2004) to the post-pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7 period (2005 to 2010) [26] . In Scotland, incidence of empyema in children rose from 6.5 per million between 1981 and 1998, to 66 per million in 2005 [27] . These trends have been reversed since the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-13. Data from the United States suggest that empyema decreased by 50% in children younger than 5 years [28] ; similarly, data from the United Kingdom and Scotland showed substantial reduction in pediatric empyema following pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-13 introduction [29, 30] .\\n\\nSeveral national guidelines from high-income countries, as well as the WHO recommendations for low-and middleincome countries, recommend that chest radiography should not be routinely performed in children with ambulatory pneumonia [31] [32] [33] . Indications for chest radiography include hospitalization, severe hypoxemia or respiratory distress, failed initial antibiotic therapy, or suspicion for other diseases (tuberculosis, inhaled foreign body) or complications. However, point-of-care lung ultrasound is emerging as a promising modality for diagnosing childhood pneumonia [34] .\\n\\nIn addition to the effect on radiologic pneumonia, pneumococcal conjugate vaccination reduces the risk of hospitalization from viral-associated pneumonia, probably by reducing bacterial-viral co-infections resulting in severe disease and hospitalization [35] . An analysis of ecological and observational studies of pneumonia incidence in different age groups soon after introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7 in Canada, Italy, Australia, Poland and the United States showed decreases in all-cause pneumonia hospitalizations ranging from 15% to 65% [36] . In the United States after pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-13 replaced pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7, there was a further 17% decrease in hospitalizations for pneumonia among children eligible for the vaccination, and a further 12% decrease among unvaccinated adults [28] .\\n\\nA systematic review of etiology studies prior to availability of new conjugate vaccines confirmed S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae type B as the most important bacterial causes of pneumonia, with Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae associated with some severe cases. Respiratory syncytial virus was the leading viral cause, identified in 15-40% of pneumonia cases, followed by influenza A and B, parainfluenza, human metapneumovirus and adenovirus [37] .\\n\\nMore recent meta-analyses of etiology data suggest a changing pathogen profile, with increasing recognition that clinical pneumonia is caused by the sequential or concurrent interaction of more than one organism. Severe disease in particular is often caused by multiple pathogens. With high coverage of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination and Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccination, viral pathogens increasingly predominate [38] . In recent case-control studies, at least one virus was detected in 87% of clinical pneumonia cases in South Africa [39] , while viruses were detected in 81% of radiologic pneumonia cases in Sweden [40] . In a large multi-center study in the United States, viral pathogens were detected in 73% of children hospitalized with radiologic pneumonia, while bacteria were detected in only 15% of cases [41] . A meta-analysis of 23 case-control studies of viral etiology in radiologically confirmed pneumonia in children, completed up to 2014, reported good evidence of causal attribution for respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, metapneumovirus and parainfluenza virus [42] . However there was no consistent evidence that many other commonly described viruses, including rhinovirus, adenovirus, bocavirus and coronavirus, were more commonly isolated from cases than from controls. Further attribution of bacterial etiology is difficult because it is often not possible to distinguish colonizing from pathogenic bacteria when they are isolated from nasal specimens [43] .\\n\\nAnother etiology is pertussis. In the last decade there has also been a resurgence in pertussis cases, especially in highincome countries [44] . Because pertussis immunity after acellular pertussis vaccination is less long-lasting than immunity after wild-type infection or whole-cell vaccination, many women of child-bearing age have waning pertussis antibody levels. Their infants might therefore be born with low transplacental anti-pertussis immunoglobulin G levels, making them susceptible to pertussis infection before completion of the primary vaccination series [45] . In 2014, more than 40,000 pertussis cases were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States; in some states, population-based incidence rates are higher than at any time in the last 70 years [44] . In contrast, most low-and middleincome countries use whole-cell pertussis vaccines and the numbers of pertussis cases in those countries were stable or decreasing until 2015 [46] . However recent evidence from South Africa (where the acellular vaccine is used) shows an appreciable incidence of pertussis among infants presenting with acute pneumonia: 2% of clinical pneumonia cases among infants enrolled in a birth cohort were caused by pertussis [39] , and 3.7% of infants and young children presenting to a tertiary academic hospital had evidence of pertussis infection [47] .\\n\\nSimilarly, childhood tuberculosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in many low-and middle-income countries, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis has increasingly been recognized as a pathogen in acute pneumonia in children living in high tuberculosis-prevalence settings. Postmortem studies of children dying from acute respiratory illness have commonly reported M. tuberculosis [48, 49] . A recent systematic review of tuberculosis as a comorbidity of childhood pneumonia reported culture-confirmed disease in about 8% of cases [50] . Because intrathoracic tuberculosis disease is only culture-confirmed in a minority of cases, the true burden could be even higher; tuberculosis could therefore be an important contributor to childhood pneumonia incidence and mortality in high-prevalence areas.\\n\\nChildhood pneumonia and clinically severe disease result from a complex interaction of host and environmental risk factors [37] . Because of the effectiveness of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination and Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccination for prevention of radiologic and clinical pneumonia, incomplete or inadequate vaccination must be considered as a major preventable risk factor for childhood pneumonia. Other risk factors include low birth weight, which is associated with 3.2 times increased odds of severe pneumonia in low-and middle-income countries, and 1.8 times increased odds in high-income countries [51] . Similarly, lack of exclusive breastfeeding for the first 4 months of life increases odds of severe pneumonia by 2.7 times in low-and middle-income countries and 1.3 times in highincome countries. Markers of undernutrition are strong risk factors for pneumonia in low-and middle-income countries only, with highly significant odds ratios for underweight for age (4.5), stunting (2.6) and wasting (2.8) . Household crowding has uniform risk, with odds ratios between 1.9 and 2.3 in both low-and middle-income countries and high-income countries. Indoor air pollution from use of solid or biomass fuels increases odds of pneumonia by 1.6 times; lack of measles vaccination by the end of the first year of age increases odds of pneumonia by 1.8 times [51] . It is estimated that the prevalence of these critical risk factors in low-and middle-income countries decreased by 25% between 2000 and 2010, contributing to reductions in pneumonia incidence and mortality in low-and middle-income countries, even in countries where conjugate vaccines have not been available [3] .\\n\\nThe single strongest risk factor for pneumonia is HIV infection, which is especially prevalent in children in sub-Saharan Africa. HIV-infected children have 6 times increased odds of developing severe pneumonia or of death compared to HIV-uninfected children [52] . Since the effective prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV, there is a growing population of HIV-exposed children who are uninfected; their excess risk of pneumonia, compared to HIV unexposed children, has been described as 1.3-to 3.4-fold higher [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] .\\n\\nThe pneumococcal conjugate vaccination and Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccination have been effective tools to decrease pneumonia incidence, severity and mortality [58, 59] . However, equitable coverage and access to vaccines remains sub-optimal. By the end of 2015, Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccination had been introduced in 73 countries, with global coverage estimated at 68%. However, inequities are still apparent among regions: in the Americas coverage is estimated at 90%, while in the Western Pacific it is only 25%. By 2015, pneumococcal conjugate vaccination had been introduced into 54 countries, with global coverage of 35% for three doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination for infant populations [60] . To address this issue, the WHO\\'s Global Vaccine Access Plan initiative was launched to make life-saving vaccines more equitably available. In addition to securing guarantees for financing of vaccines, the program objectives include building political will in low-and middle-income countries to commit to immunization as a priority, social marketing to individuals and communities, strengthening health systems and promoting relevant local research and development innovations [61] .\\n\\nMaternal vaccination to prevent disease in the youngest infants has been shown to be effective for tetanus, influenza and pertussis [62] . Influenza vaccination during pregnancy is safe, provides reasonable maternal protection against influenza, and also protects infants for a limited period from confirmed influenza infection (vaccine efficacy 63% in Bangladesh [63] and 50.4% in South Africa [64] ). However as antibody levels drop sharply after birth, infant protection does not persist much beyond 8 weeks [65] . Recently respiratory syncytial virus vaccination in pregnancy has been shown to be safe and immunogenic, and a phase-3 clinical trial of efficacy at preventing respiratory syncytial virus disease in infants is under way [66] . Within a decade, respiratory syncytial virus in infancy might be vaccine-preventable, with further decreases in pneumonia incidence, morbidity and mortality [67] .\\n\\nImproved access to health care, better nutrition and improved living conditions might contribute to further decreases in childhood pneumonia burden. The WHO Integrated Global Action Plan for diarrhea and pneumonia highlights many opportunities to protect, prevent and treat children [68] . Breastfeeding rates can be improved by programs that combine education and counseling interventions in homes, communities and health facilities, and by promotion of baby-friendly hospitals [69] . Improved home ventilation, cleaner cooking fuels and reduction in exposure to cigarette smoke are essential interventions to reduce the incidence and severity of pneumonia [70, 71] . Prevention of pediatric HIV is possible by providing interventions to prevent mother-to-child transmission [72] . Early infant HIV testing and early initiation of antiretroviral therapy and cotrimoxazole prophylaxis can substantially reduce the incidence of community-acquired pneumonia among HIV-infected children [73] . Community-based interventions reduce pneumonia mortality and have the indirect effect of improved-careseeking behavior [58] . If these cost-effective interventions were scaled up, it is estimated that 67% of pneumonia deaths in lowand middle-income countries could be prevented by 2025 [58] .\\n\\nCase management of pneumonia is a strategy by which severity of disease is classified as severe or non-severe. All children receive early, appropriate oral antibiotics, and severe cases are referred for parenteral antibiotics. When implemented in highburden areas before the availability of conjugate vaccines, case management as part of Integrated Management of Childhood Illness was associated with a 27% decrease in overall child mortality, and 42% decrease in pneumonia-specific mortality [74] . However the predominance of viral causes of pneumonia and low case fatality have prompted concern about overuse of antibiotics. Several randomized controlled trials comparing oral antibiotics to placebo for non-severe pneumonia have been performed [75] [76] [77] and others are ongoing [78] . In two studies, performed in Denmark and in India, outcomes of antibiotic and placebo treatments were equivalent [76, 77] . In the third study, in Pakistan, there was a non-significant 24% vs. 20% rate of failure in the placebo group, which was deemed to be non-equivalent to the antibiotic group [75] . Furthermore, because WHO-classified non-severe pneumonia and bronchiolitis might be considered within a spectrum of lower respiratory disease, many children with clinical pneumonia could actually have viral bronchiolitis, for which antibiotics are not beneficial [79] . This has been reflected in British [33] and Spanish [31] national pneumonia guidelines, which do not recommend routine antibiotic treatment for children younger than 2 years with evidence of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination who present with non-severe pneumonia. The United States\\' national guidelines recommend withholding antibiotics in children up to age 5 years presenting with non-severe pneumonia [32] . However, given the high mortality from pneumonia in low-and middle-income countries, the lack of easy access to care, and the high prevalence of risk factors for severe disease, revised World Health Organization pneumonia guidelines still recommend antibiotic treatment for all children who meet the WHO pneumonia case definitions [80] .\\n\\nUse of supplemental oxygen is life-saving, but this is not universally available in low-and middle-income countries; it is estimated that use of supplemental oxygen systems could reduce mortality of children with hypoxic pneumonia by 20% [81] . Identifying systems capacity to increase availability of oxygen in health facilities, and identifying barriers to further implementation are among the top 15 priorities for future childhood pneumonia research [82] . However, up to 81% of pneumonia deaths in 2010 occurred outside health facilities [5] , so there are major challenges with access to health services and health-seeking behavior of vulnerable populations. Identifying and changing the barriers to accessing health care is an important area with the potential to impact the survival and health of the most vulnerable children [82] .\\n\\nMuch progress has been made in decreasing deaths caused by childhood pneumonia. Improved socioeconomic status and vaccinations, primarily the conjugate vaccines (against Haemophilus influenzae and pneumococcus), have led to substantial reductions in the incidence and severity of childhood pneumonia. Stronger strategies to prevent and manage HIV have reduced HIV-associated pneumonia deaths. However, despite the substantial changes in incidence, etiology and radiology globally, there remain inequities in access to care and availability of effective interventions, especially in low-and middle-income countries. Effective interventions need to be more widely available and new interventions developed for the residual burden of childhood pneumonia.'}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '11ea9ab8e60568e1dffc3e36df638c19'}>,\n",

OBJECTIVE: To assess the magnitude of mental health outcomes and associated factors among health care workers treating patients exposed to COVID-19 in China. DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional, survey-based, region-stratified study collected demographic data and mental health measurements from 1257 health care workers in 34 hospitals from January 29, 2020, to February 3, 2020, in China. Health care workers in hospitals equipped with fever clinics or wards for patients with COVID-19 were eligible. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The degree of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress was assessed by the Chinese versions of the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, the 7-item Insomnia Severity Index, and the 22-item Impact of Event Scale–Revised, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with mental health outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 1257 of 1830 contacted individuals completed the survey, with a participation rate of 68.7%. A total of 813 (64.7%) were aged 26 to 40 years, and 964 (76.7%) were women. Of all participants, 764 (60.8%) were nurses, and 493 (39.2%) were physicians; 760 (60.5%) worked in hospitals in Wuhan, and 522 (41.5%) were frontline health care workers. A considerable proportion of participants reported symptoms of depression (634 [50.4%]), anxiety (560 [44.6%]), insomnia (427 [34.0%]), and distress (899 [71.5%]). Nurses, women, frontline health care workers, and those working in Wuhan, China, reported more severe degrees of all measurements of mental health symptoms than other health care workers (eg, median [IQR] Patient Health Questionnaire scores among physicians vs nurses: 4.0 [1.0-7.0] vs 5.0 [2.0-8.0]; P = .007; median [interquartile range {IQR}] Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale scores among men vs women: 2.0 [0-6.0] vs 4.0 [1.0-7.0]; P < .001; median [IQR] Insomnia Severity Index scores among frontline vs second-line workers: 6.0 [2.0-11.0] vs 4.0 [1.0-8.0]; P < .001; median [IQR] Impact of Event Scale–Revised scores among those in Wuhan vs those in Hubei outside Wuhan and those outside Hubei: 21.0 [8.5-34.5] vs 18.0 [6.0-28.0] in Hubei outside Wuhan and 15.0 [4.0-26.0] outside Hubei; P < .001). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed participants from outside Hubei province were associated with lower risk of experiencing symptoms of distress compared with those in Wuhan (odds ratio [OR], 0.62; 95% CI, 0.43-0.88; P = .008). Frontline health care workers engaged in direct diagnosis, treatment, and care of patients with COVID-19 were associated with a higher risk of symptoms of depression (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.11-2.09; P = .01), anxiety (OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.22-2.02; P < .001), insomnia (OR, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.92-4.60; P < .001), and distress (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.25-2.04; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this survey of heath care workers in hospitals equipped with fever clinics or wards for patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan and other regions in China, participants reported experiencing psychological burden, especially nurses, women, those in Wuhan, and frontline health care workers directly engaged in the diagnosis, treatment, and care for patients with COVID-19.\\n\\nText: Abbreviation: PHQ-9, 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire; GAD-7, 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder; ISI, 7-item Insomnia Severity Index; IES-R, 22-item Impact of Event Abbreviation: IES-R, 22-item Impact of Event Scale-Revised; IQR, interquartile range.

In this study, microRNA, mRNA and cytokine/chemokine secretion profiling were investigated for human monocyte-derived macrophages infected in-vitro with Influenza virus A/H1N1 and/or Streptococcus pneumoniae. We observed that the in-vitro co-infection synergistically increased interferon-γ-induced protein-10 (CXCL10, IP-10) expression compared to the singly-infected cells conditions. We demonstrated that endogenous miRNA-200a-3p, whose expression was synergistically induced following co-infection, indirectly regulates CXCL10 expression by targeting suppressor of cytokine signaling-6 (SOCS-6), a well-known regulator of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Additionally, in a subsequent clinical pilot study, immunomodulators levels were evaluated in samples from 74 children (≤5 years-old) hospitalized with viral and/or bacterial community-acquired pneumonia. Clinically, among the 74 cases of pneumonia, patients with identified mixed-detection had significantly higher (3.6-fold) serum IP-10 levels than those with a single detection (P = 0.03), and were significantly associated with severe pneumonia (P < 0.01). This study demonstrates that viral and bacterial co-infection modulates the JAK-STAT signaling pathway and leads to exacerbated IP-10 expression, which could play a major role in the pathogenesis of pneumonia.\\n\\nText: Scientific RepoRts | 6:38532 | DOI: 10 .1038/srep38532 pathogenesis of several diseases and has been suggested as a potential biomarker of viral infection 10, 11 , late-onset bacterial infection in premature infants 12 , and a promising biomarker of sepsis and septic shock 13, 14 . Combined analysis of IP-10 and IFN-γ has also been reported as a useful biomarker for diagnosis and monitoring therapeutic efficacy in patients with active tuberculosis [15] [16] [17] , and both remain detectable in the urine of patients with pulmonary diseases in the absence of renal dysfunction 18 .\\n\\nWith airway epithelial cells 19 , resident alveolar macrophages (AMs) and blood monocytes-derived macrophages (recruited into tissues under inflammatory conditions 20, 21 ) represent a major line of defense against both pneumococcal (through their high phagocytic capacity [22] [23] [24] ) and influenza infection 25, 26 . So far, no studies have yet focused on the intracellular mechanisms that regulate IP-10 in human blood leukocytes during mixed IAV and SP infection. Several studies indicated that host non-coding small RNAs (including microRNAs) may function as immunomodulators by regulating several pivotal intracellular processes, such as the innate immune response 27 and antiviral activity 28, 29 ; both of these processes are closely related to toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways.\\n\\nIn this study, we firstly investigated the in vitro intracellular mechanisms that mediate the innate immune response in IAV and/or SP infected human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). Using this approach, we observed that mixed-infection of MDMs induces a synergistic production of IP-10 which can be related to a miRNA-200a/JAK-STAT/SOCS-6 regulatory pathway. Subsequently, in a retrospective analysis of clinical samples collected from children ≤ 5 years-old hospitalized with pneumonia, we confirmed that serum IP-10 level could be related to both viral and/or bacterial etiologies and disease severity.\\n\\nCharacteristics of MDMs infected by IAV and/or SP. Initially, we investigated in vitro the impact of single and mixed IAV and SP infection on MDMs. Firstly, active replication of IAV was assessed by qRT-PCR and quantification of new infectious viral particles in the cell supernatants ( Fig. 1a,b ). IAV titer increased over time after single infection with IAV and correlated with increased production of negative-strand IAV RNA. Maximum viral replication was observed at 18-24 hours post-infection, after which time both RNA replication and the quantity of infectious particles decreased. In this in vitro model, subsequent challenge of IAV-infected MDMs with SP had no significant impact on the production of new infectious viral particles (Fig. 1b) . Together, these results indicate permissive and productive infection of MDMs by IAV. Secondly, we evaluated whether MDMs are permissive for both IAV and SP infection. The presence of pneumococci within IAV-and SP-infected primary MDMs was confirmed at 8 h post-infection (Fig. 1c) , suggesting that MDMs are permissive for viral and bacterial co-infection in the early steps of infection. Importantly, confocal co-detection of mixed IAV and SP was only effective following 8 h post-infection due to the bactericidal impact of SP internalization within human macrophages (after 24 h, data not shown). Thirdly, we evaluated the impact of single and mixed infection with IAV and SP on MDM viability. Mixed infection significantly decreased cell viability (65.2 ± 4.5% total cell death at 48 hours post-infection; P < 0.0001) compared to single SP and IAV infection (39.6 ± 1.7% and 17.4 ± 1.1% total cell death, respectively; Fig. 1d ). Taken together, these results confirmed human MDMs are permissive to mixed viral and bacterial infection. mRNA, microRNA and protein expression profiling reveal an overall induction of the host innate immune response following IAV and/or SP infection of MDMs. To investigate the innate immune response orchestrated by IAV-and SP-infected human MDMs, we firstly evaluated the expression of 84 genes involved in the innate and adaptive immune responses (Table S1) ; the major differentially-expressed genes are summarized in Fig. 2a . Expression profiling indicated an overall induction of genes related to the JAK-STAT, NF-Κ β and TLR signaling pathways. Indeed, all interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) screened, including CXCL10 (fold-change [FC] = 240.9), CCL-2 (FC = 34.2) and MX-1 (FC = 151.4) were upregulated following mixed infection compared to uninfected cells, most of which are closely related to STAT-1 (FC = 52.3), IRF-7 (FC = 6.8) and IFNB1 (FC = 5.2) also found upregulated in mixed infected cells. Secondly, we investigated the endogenous microRNA expression profiles of IAV-and SP-infected MDMs. A selection of microRNAs that were found to be differentially-expressed under different infection conditions are shown in Fig. 2b and Table S2 . MiRNA-200a-3p was overexpressed after both single IAV (FC = 6.9), single SP (FC = 3.7) and mixed IAV/SP infection (FC = 7.3), indicating this miRNA may play a role in the innate immune response to viral and bacterial co-infection. Similar miRNA-200a-3p dysregulation profiles were obtained following IAV and/or SP infections of human macrophages-like (THP-1 monocytes-derived macrophages) or primary MDMs (data not shown). Thirdly, the secreted levels of various antiviral, pro-inflammatory and immunomodulatory cytokines/chemokines were assayed in IAV-and SP-infected-THP-1 and primary MDM cell supernatants. We observed a remarkable correlation between the mRNA and protein expression profiles of single or mixed infected MDMs especially regarding CXCL-10 and IP-10 expression. Indeed, the level of IP-10 was synergistically increased in the supernatant of IAV-infected THP-1 MDMs exposed to SP (mean: 30,589 ± 16,484 pg ml −1 ) compared to single IAV infection (1,439 ± 566.5 pg ml −1 ) and single SP infection (4,472 ± 2,001 pg ml −1 ; P≤ 0.05; Fig. 2c ) at 24 hours after infection. In those cells, IP-10 expression reduced over time (48 to 72 hours), coinciding with a significant higher proportion of necrotic and apoptotic cells (Fig. 1d) . The synergistic expression of IP-10 was similarly observed at 24 hours post-infection using primary MDMs (Fig. 2d) . Significantly increased secretion of the other tested cytokines and chemokines was not observed post-infection, even in mixed infected MDMs (Fig. S1 ). Interestingly, a significant production of IP-10 was also observed in supernatants of primary human airway epithelial cells (HAEC) mixed-infected by IAV and SP compared to the single infections (Fig. 2e) . Taken together, the mRNA and protein profiling results suggested that mixed viral and bacterial infection of MDMs induces a synergistic pro-inflammatory response related to the type-1 interferon and JAK-STAT signaling pathways, with IP-10 as signature of IAV/SP co-infection. Among all microRNAs screened, miR-200a-3p was the most Scientific RepoRts | 6:38532 | DOI: 10.1038/srep38532 overexpressed in IAV/SP co-infection of human MDMs. In the remainder of this study, we decided to investigate the interconnection between miR-200a-3p expression and the innate immune response.\\n\\nEndogenous miRNA-200a-3p expression correlates with CXCL10 (IP-10) induction following mixed IAV and SP infection of human MDMs. Using a specific Taqman probe assay targeting miR-200a-3p, we confirmed a significant upregulation of miR-200a-3p following mixed IAV and SP infection of human MDMs (Fig. 3a) . In this experiment, a more marked up-regulation of miR-200a-3p was observed following IAV+ SP compared to results obtained previously (Fig. 2b) . This discrepancy has been attributed to the use of two different approaches to quantify miR-200a-3p expression. The use of a target-specific stem-loop reverse transcription primer in Fig. 3a allows a better sensitivity of miR-200a-3p detection compared to the non-specific fluorescent dye used in Fig. 2b . As the general trend was suggestive of a synergistic induction of miR-200a-3p in response to mixed infection (Fig. 3a) , we hypothesized microRNA-200a-3p may play a role in the regulation of CXCL10 (IP-10), which was also synergistically upregulated in mixed-infected MDMs ( Fig. 2c and d) and primary HAEC ( Statistical analyses were performed using two-way ANOVA with Tukey\\'s post-hoc test; *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001.\\n\\nScientific RepoRts | 6:38532 | DOI: 10.1038/srep38532 CXCL10 (Fig. 3d) . These results suggested miR-200a-3p indirectly regulates CXCL10 and led us to hypothesize that miR-200a-3p controls a potential repressor of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. . At 18 h after transfection, the MDMs were singly or mixed infected as described previously. At 8 h post-IAV and/or SP infection, total mRNA was extracted and amplified by PCR using specific primers for the indicated genes. Values represent median ± IQR (a, c) or mean ± SEM (d, e) of three biological replicates. Statistical analyses were performed using a Kruskal-Wallis test (non-parametric, one-way ANOVA with Dunn\\'s post-hoc test) for data presented in (a, c). An ordinary two-way ANOVA (with Tukey\\'s post-hoc multiple comparison test) was used for data presented in (d, e). *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001. MiRNA-200a-3p indirectly regulates IP-10 expression by targeting SOCS6. As shown in Fig. 2a , several JAK-STAT signaling pathway genes were deregulated in mixed IAV-and SP-infected human MDMs; therefore, we hypothesized that miR-200a-3p directly regulates a regulator of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Predictive target analysis indicated that the 3\\' UTR of suppressor of cytokine signaling-6 (SOCS6) may be targeted by miR-200a-3p (Fig. 3b) . SOCS proteins constitute a class of negative regulators of JAK-STAT signaling pathways that are induced by both cytokines and TLR signaling. MiRNA-200a-3p was not predicted to target any of the other six members of the SOCS gene family. Transfection of human MDMs with MIM-200a downregulated SOCS6 (FC = 0.57) while inhibition of miR-200a-3p (INH-200a) upregulated SOCS6 (FC = 1.55), confirming that miR-200a-3p effectively regulates the expression of SOCS6 (Fig. 3e) . Moreover, SOCS6 was synergistically downregulated in IAV-or IAV/SP-infected MDMs overexpressing miRNA-200a (Fig. 3e) , suggesting that both infection and miR-200a-3p negatively regulate the expression of SOCS6. Finally, western blotting confirmed that expression of SOCS-6 sharply reduced following infection, especially after mixed IAV and SP infection (Fig. 3f) .\\n\\nThese results indicate miR-200a-3p is strongly induced in response to mixed viral and bacterial co-infection, which in turn leads to downregulation of the JAK-STAT regulator SOCS-6 at both the mRNA and protein levels and subsequent upregulation of IP-10.\\n\\nanalyses demonstrated mixed IAV and SP infection of human MDMs and HAEC induced significant production of IP-10. As blood leukocytes and respiratory tract epithelial cells actively contribute to inflammation during pneumonia, we hypothesized the level of IP-10 in serum of patient with pneumonia may be both indicative of mixed respiratory infection and disease severity. As part of a prospective, hospital-based, multicenter case-control study on the etiology of pneumonia among children under 5-years-old, a total of 74 patients (44 male, 30 female) were included in this pilot evaluation. According to WHO guidelines, retrospective analysis indicated 44 (59.5%) children had clinical signs of non-severe pneumonia and 30 (40.5%) children had signs of severe pneumonia. The main patient characteristics at inclusion are shown in Table 1 . Patients with severe pneumonia had significant more recorded episodes of dyspnea (P < 0.001), cyanosis (P = 0.03), lower chest indrawing (P < 0.001), dullness to percussion (P < 0.001) and lethargy (P < 0.001) during chest examination than patient with non-severe pneumonia. Moreover, pleural effusions were significantly more observed among critically ill patients and the duration of hospitalization was significantly longer for the children with severe pneumonia than for those with non-severe pneumonia (P = 0.0015). Two deaths occurred within the group of children retrospectively defined with severe pneumonia. Evaluation of the systemic inflammatory response of the 74 cases is shown in Table 2 . Serum level of CRP, IP-10, PCT, G-CSF, IL-6, IL-8 and MIP-1β were significantly more elevated in serum samples from critically ill patients. Patients with severe pneumonia had significantly higher (4.2-fold) serum IP-10 levels than those with a non-severe pneumonia (P < 0.001) suggesting IP-10 as a promising prognostic marker in pneumonia. Diagnostic accuracy measures for predicting pneumonia severity using blood-based biomarkers are summarized in Table S3 . Briefly, in this study, the optimal IP-10 cut-off value for identifying patient with severe pneumonia was 4,240 pg ml −1 , with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.69 (95% CI, 0.57 to 0.82, P < 0.001). Defining as positive a serum IP-10 level above this cut-off resulted in a sensitivity of 63.3%, specificity of 63.6% and a positive likelihood ratio of 1.74. Prognostic values of IP-10 were closed to procalcitonin (PCT; AUC = 0.70; 95% IC, 0.58 to 0.82, P < 0.001) and IL-6 (AUC = 0.70; 95% IC, 0.58-0.83, P < 0.001).\\n\\nMultiplex PCR-based screening of respiratory and blood samples reveal a high variety of pathogen associations (Table 3) . Respiratory viruses were detected in the nasal aspirates (NAs) of 63/74 patients (85.1%). Etiological bacteria of pneumonia (S. pneumoniae, n = 19; S. aureus, n = 1; or H. influenzae type B, n = 7) were identified via real-time PCR in the blood samples of 27/74 (36.5%) of the patients. Multiplex PCR assays allowed the identification of respiratory bacteria in the blood of 19 patients with negative blood culture results. Among the 74 cases PCR-positive for respiratory pathogens, a single virus or bacteria were detected in the NAs of 7 (9.4%) and 3 (4.0%) patients, respectively; these 10/74 (13.5%) cases were defined as the single infection group. The mixed infection group included the 62/74 (83.8%) cases in which (1) multiple viruses and/or bacteria were identified in NAs (38/74; 51.3%) without any bacteria identified in blood samples or (2) one or more viruses and/or bacteria were identified in NAs and associated with a blood bacteremia (24/74; 32.4%). We evaluated whether IP-10 serum level could correlate with the viral and bacterial etiologies of pneumonia. Patients with mixed infection had significant higher (3.6-fold) IP-10 serum level than patient with single detection (P = 0.03; Table 4 ). A stratified analysis reveals that the highest IP-10 serum level was observed among patients with both several respiratory pathogens identified (mixed-detection group) and severe pneumonia (14,427 pg ml −1 , IQR (3,981-82,994). In detail, a remarkable IP-10 serum level (142,531 pg ml −1 ), representing 33-fold higher above cut-off value predicting pneumonia severity was observed in patient with hRV in NA co-detected with S. pneumoniae (serotype 14) in pleural effusion and blood. In concordance with our in-vitro model of co-infection, a significant IP-10 level (90,338 pg ml −1 ) was quantified in blood sample of patient with severe bacteremic pneumococcal (serotype 14) pneumonia with a positive co-detection of Influenza B virus in NA. Taken together, these results suggest that high serum IP-10 levels are significantly associated with mixed viral and bacterial detection and also related to pneumonia pathogenesis.\\n\\nThis study provides additional in vitro and clinical data to improve our understanding of the immunopathology of mixed viral and bacterial pneumonia (Fig. 4) .\\n\\nThe in vitro model of influenza and pneumococcal superinfection of human MDMs demonstrated that mixed infection synergistically induced release of the pro-inflammatory chemokine IP-10, strongly suggesting human Scientific RepoRts | 6:38532 | DOI: 10.1038/srep38532 blood leukocytes contribute to the immunopathology of pneumonia. Additionally, transcriptomics and omics analyses provided new data on the inflammatory pathways that are activated during mixed infection and related to synergistic induction of the pro-inflammatory chemokine IP-10 in mixed infected cells. Our observations are consistent with a recent study describing IP-10 induction as host-proteome signature of both viral and bacterial infections 30 . Of the differentially-expressed genes observed in mixed infected MDMs, the transcription factors STAT-1 and IRF-7 appear to play crucial roles in the regulation of interferon-stimulated genes including CXCL10 (IP-10). By focusing on the intracellular mechanisms that regulate inflammatory pathways, we demonstrated a novel role for miRNA-200a-3p in the regulation of CXCL10 (IP-10). These observations are consistent with previous reports showing that RNA virus infection upregulates miR-155 in macrophages and dendritic cells and also regulates suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1), suggesting the existence of a miRNA/JAK-STAT/SOCS regulatory pathway during viral infection 29 . Our study suggests co-infection leads to overexpression of miR-200a-3p, which in turn targets and downregulates the JAK-STAT regulator SOCS-6 and consequently increases CXCL10 (IP-10) expression. Interestingly, a complementary in-silico approach reveals that several microRNAs that were found dysregulated in our experiments of IAV and SP co-infection of MDMs or HAEC, might target several genes of SOCS family and play similar role than miR-200a-3p. Indeed, miRNA-142-3p might target SOCS4, 5, 6 mRNA while miRNA-194-5p might target SOCS2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 mRNA. These observations underline that intra-cellular regulation of IP-10 is not limited to the contribution of a sole microRNA. A complex inter-relationship between numerous host microRNAs and inhibitors of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway occur to control host innate inflammatory response against viral and/or bacterial infections. Clinically, the majority of pediatric CAP cases in this study were associated with both positive viral and/or bacterial detection. Respiratory microorganisms were detected in 97% of cases; 51.3% of which were viral-viral, viral-bacterial or bacterial-bacterial co-detected only in nasal aspirates, 32.4% of which co-detected in both nasal aspirates and blood samples. These data are consistent with previous etiological studies of pediatric CAP 3,31-33 . S. pneumoniae was the major bacteria identified in blood (19/74; 25.7%) and mainly co-detected with respiratory viruses in NAs (16/19; 84.2%). We observed a very high diversity of viral and bacterial associations in biological samples from children with pneumonia. In comparison with IAV and SP14 combination evaluated in-vitro, no pneumonia cases were singly influenza and pneumococcus infected, and no similar co-detection with those two pathogens has been clinically observed. Nevertheless, Influenza B (IVB) virus was identified in 5 patients and two of them had a positive SP co-detection in blood (one non-typable strain and one serotype 14 using our molecular typing test). IVB and SP14 combination seems to be the nearest pathogen co-detection to that in-vitro investigated. Clinically, this co-detection was associated with both a very high IP-10 expression and a very severe pneumonia case definition. Interestingly, our translational pilot evaluation reveals IP-10 expression can be induced by several different viral and/or bacterial combinations. As immune response to each pathogen is different, further in-vitro investigations using different pathogens associations are needed to better characterize the mechanisms involved in the immunopathology of pneumonia.\\n\\nIn this cohort, highest serum IP-10 levels were identified among patients with both several pathogen detected and severe pneumonia, suggesting a significant role of IP-10 on pneumonia pathogenesis. Indeed, high plasma levels of IP-10 have previously been reported in patients with sepsis 12 , and were associated with high mortality rate, especially among patients with CAP 34 . Additionally, the IP-10-CXCR3 axis has been related to acute immune lung injury and lymphocyte apoptosis during the development of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 35, 36 . Moreover, an in vivo study that modeled influenza and pneumococcal superinfection in mice indicated that pro-inflammatory chemokines, including IP-10, play a crucial role in influenza-induced susceptibility to lung neutrophilia, severe immunopathology and mortality 37 . In this study, markedly elevated IP-10 (92,809 pg ml −1 ) combined with the highest PCT level (74.4 pg ml −1 ) were quantified in the serum sample of a child who died, in whom S. pneumoniae (serotype 9 V) was identified in the blood (PCR and blood culture) and co-detected with Haemophilus influenzae type B in nasal aspirate. These observations suggest an interrelationship between co-detection, elevated serum IP-10 and the pathogenesis of pneumonia.\\n\\nSeveral limitations of this pilot translational study need to be acknowledged before concluding mixed infection is related to elevated IP-10 and disease severity. Indeed, although viral shedding (e.g., of HRV and HBoV) is common in asymptomatic children, we were unable to evaluate the levels of immunomodulators in the serum samples of a control group. Moreover, although the samples were collected within the first 24 hours after admission, only a single blood sample was processed for each patient. Therefore, a larger, longitudinal study on the etiology and severity of pneumonia will be necessary to confirm these results. In conclusion, the present findings suggest that mixed respiratory infections and IP-10 may play major, interconnected roles in the pathogenesis of pneumonia. Clinically, assessment and monitoring of induced IP-10 serum level may assist clinicians to improve diagnosis and patient management of severe community-acquired pneumonia.\\n\\nViral and bacterial strains.

Based on these primary criteria defining pneumonia cases, all 74 cases were retrospectively re-evaluated according to the WHO \"Pocket book of hospital care for children\" 45 criteria to evaluate pneumonia severity. Cases that died during the study, or who had at least one additional clinical signs including central cyanosis, dullness to percussion during chest examination, prostration/lethargy, pleural effusion observed on chest radiography were retrospectively included in the severe pneumonia group. Patients without any of these additional clinical signs were included in the non-severe pneumonia group. Table 4 . a IP-10 values are expressed in pg ml -1 .

Over the last 20 years, there has been a substantial decrease in the incidence of childhood pneumonia and pneumonia-associated mortality. New conjugate vaccines against Haemophilus influenzae type b and Streptococcus pneumoniae have contributed to decreases in radiologic, clinical and complicated pneumonia cases and have reduced hospitalization and mortality. The importance of co-infections with multiple pathogens and the predominance of viral-associated disease are emerging. Better access to effective preventative and management strategies is needed in low- and middle-income countries, while new strategies are needed to address the residual burden of disease once these have been implemented.\\n\\nText: Pneumonia has been the leading cause of death in children younger than 5 years for decades. Although there have been substantial decreases in overall child mortality and in pneumonia-specific mortality, pneumonia remains the major single cause of death in children outside the neonatal period, causing approximately 900,000 of the estimated 6.3 million child deaths in 2013 [1] . Substantial advances have occurred in the understanding of risk factors and etiology of pneumonia, in development of standardized case definitions, and in prevention with the production of improved vaccines and in treatment. Such advances have led to changes in the epidemiology, etiology and mortality from childhood pneumonia. However in many areas access to these interventions remains sub-optimal, with large inequities between and within countries and regions. In this paper we review the impact of recent preventative and management advances in pneumonia epidemiology, etiology, radiologic presentation and outcome in children.\\n\\nThe overall burden of childhood pneumonia has been reduced substantially over the last decade, despite an increase in the global childhood population from 605 million in 2000 to 664 million in 2015 [2] . Recent data suggest that there has been a 25% decrease in the incidence of pneumonia, from 0.29 episodes per child year in low-and middle-income countries in 2000, to 0.22 episodes per child year in 2010 [3] . This is substantiated by a 58% decrease in pneumonia-associated disability-adjusted life years between 1990 and 2013, from 186 million to 78 million as estimated in the Global Burden of Disease study [1] . Pneumonia deaths decreased from 1.8 million in 2000 to 900,000 in 2013 [1] . These data do not reflect the full impact of increasingly widespread use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in low-and middle-income countries because the incidence of pneumonia and number of deaths are likely to decrease still further as a result of this widespread intervention [4] .\\n\\nNotwithstanding this progress, there remains a disproportionate burden of disease in low-and middle-income countries, where more than 90% of pneumonia cases and deaths occur. The incidence in high-income countries is estimated at 0.015 episodes per child year, compared to 0.22 episodes per child year in low-and middle-income countries [3] . On average, 1 in 66 children in high-income countries is affected by pneumonia per year, compared to 1 in 5 children in low-and middle-income countries. Even within low-and middleincome countries there are regional inequities and challenges with access to health care services: up to 81% of severe pneumonia deaths occur outside a hospital [5] . In addition to a higher incidence of pneumonia, the case fatality rate is estimated to be almost 10-fold higher in low-and middle-income countries as compared to high-income countries [3, 5] .\\n\\nChildhood pneumonia can also lead to significant morbidity and chronic disease. Early life pneumonia can impair longterm lung health by decreasing lung function [6] . Severe or recurrent pneumonia can have a worse effect on lung function; increasing evidence suggests that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease might be related to early childhood pneumonia [7, 8] . A meta-analysis of the risk of long-term outcomes after childhood pneumonia categorized chronic respiratory sequelae into major (restrictive lung disease, obstructive lung disease, bronchiectasis) and minor (chronic bronchitis, asthma, abnormal pulmonary function) groups [9] . The risk of developing at least one of the major sequelae was estimated as 6% after an ambulatory pneumonia event and 14% after an episode of hospitalized pneumonia. Because respiratory diseases affect almost 1 billion people globally and are a major cause of mortality and morbidity [10] , childhood pneumonia might contribute to substantial morbidity across the life course.\\n\\nChest radiologic changes have been considered the gold standard for defining a pneumonia event [11] because clinical findings can be subjective and clinical definitions of pneumonia can be nonspecific. In 2005, to aid in defining outcomes of pneumococcal vaccine studies, the World Health Organization\\'s (WHO) standardized chest radiograph description defined a group of children who were considered most likely to have pneumococcal pneumonia [12] . The term \"end-point consolidation\" was described as a dense or fluffy opacity that occupies a portion or whole of a lobe, or the entire lung. \"Other infiltrate\" included linear and patchy densities, peribronchial thickening, minor patchy infiltrates that are not of sufficient magnitude to constitute primary end-point consolidation, and small areas of atelectasis that in children can be difficult to distinguish from consolidation. \"Primary end-point pneumonia\" included either end-point consolidation or a pleural effusion associated with a pulmonary parenchymal infiltrate (including \"other\" infiltrate).\\n\\nWidespread use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination and Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccination has decreased the incidence of radiologic pneumonia. In a review of four randomized controlled trials and two case-control studies of Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccination in high-burden communities, the vaccination was associated with an 18% decrease in radiologic pneumonia [13] . Introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination was associated with a 26% decrease in radiologic pneumonia in California between 1995 and 1998 [14] . In vaccine efficacy trials in low-and middle-income countries, pneumococcal conjugate vaccination reduced radiologic pneumonia by 37% in the Gambia [15] , 25% in South Africa [16] and 26% in the Philippines [17] .\\n\\nThe WHO radiologic case definition was not intended to distinguish bacterial from viral etiology but rather to define a sub-set of pneumonia cases in which pneumococcal infection was considered more likely and to provide a set of standardized definitions through which researchers could achieve broad agreement in reporting chest radiographs. However, despite widespread field utilization, there are concerns regarding inter-observer repeatability. There has been good consensus for the description of lobar consolidation but significant disagreement on the description of patchy and perihilar infiltrates [18, 19] . In addition, many children with clinically severe lung disease do not have primary end-point pneumonia: in one pre-pneumococcal conjugate vaccination study, only 34% of children hospitalized with pneumonia had primary end-point pneumonia [20] . A revised case definition of \"presumed bacterial pneumonia\" has been introduced, and this definition includes pneumonia cases with WHO-defined alveolar consolidation, as well as those with other abnormal chest radiograph infiltrates and a serum C-reactive protein of at least 40 mg/L [21, 22] . This definition has been shown to have greater sensitivity than the original WHO radiologic definition of primary end-point pneumonia for detecting the burden of pneumonia prevented by pneumococcal conjugate vaccination [23] . Using the revised definition, the 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-10), had a vaccine efficacy of 22% in preventing presumed bacterial pneumonia in young children in South America [22] , and pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-13 had a vaccine efficacy of 39% in preventing presumed bacterial pneumonia in children older than 16 weeks who were not infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in South Africa [21] . Thus there is convincing evidence that pneumococcal conjugate vaccination decreases the incidence of radiologic pneumonia; however there is no evidence to suggest that pneumococcal conjugate vaccination modifies the radiologic appearance of pneumococcal pneumonia.\\n\\nEmpyema is a rare complication of pneumonia. An increased incidence of empyema in children was noted in some high-income countries following pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7 introduction, and this was attributed to pneumococcal serotypes not included in pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7, especially 3 and 19A [24] . In the United States, evidence from a national hospital database suggests that the incidence of empyema increased 1.9-fold between 1996 and 2008 [25] . In Australia, the incidence rate ratio increased by 1.4 times when comparing the pre-pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7 period (1998 to 2004) to the post-pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7 period (2005 to 2010) [26] . In Scotland, incidence of empyema in children rose from 6.5 per million between 1981 and 1998, to 66 per million in 2005 [27] . These trends have been reversed since the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-13. Data from the United States suggest that empyema decreased by 50% in children younger than 5 years [28] ; similarly, data from the United Kingdom and Scotland showed substantial reduction in pediatric empyema following pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-13 introduction [29, 30] .\\n\\nSeveral national guidelines from high-income countries, as well as the WHO recommendations for low-and middleincome countries, recommend that chest radiography should not be routinely performed in children with ambulatory pneumonia [31] [32] [33] . Indications for chest radiography include hospitalization, severe hypoxemia or respiratory distress, failed initial antibiotic therapy, or suspicion for other diseases (tuberculosis, inhaled foreign body) or complications. However, point-of-care lung ultrasound is emerging as a promising modality for diagnosing childhood pneumonia [34] .\\n\\nIn addition to the effect on radiologic pneumonia, pneumococcal conjugate vaccination reduces the risk of hospitalization from viral-associated pneumonia, probably by reducing bacterial-viral co-infections resulting in severe disease and hospitalization [35] . An analysis of ecological and observational studies of pneumonia incidence in different age groups soon after introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7 in Canada, Italy, Australia, Poland and the United States showed decreases in all-cause pneumonia hospitalizations ranging from 15% to 65% [36] . In the United States after pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-13 replaced pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7, there was a further 17% decrease in hospitalizations for pneumonia among children eligible for the vaccination, and a further 12% decrease among unvaccinated adults [28] .\\n\\nA systematic review of etiology studies prior to availability of new conjugate vaccines confirmed S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae type B as the most important bacterial causes of pneumonia, with Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae associated with some severe cases. Respiratory syncytial virus was the leading viral cause, identified in 15-40% of pneumonia cases, followed by influenza A and B, parainfluenza, human metapneumovirus and adenovirus [37] .\\n\\nMore recent meta-analyses of etiology data suggest a changing pathogen profile, with increasing recognition that clinical pneumonia is caused by the sequential or concurrent interaction of more than one organism. Severe disease in particular is often caused by multiple pathogens. With high coverage of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination and Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccination, viral pathogens increasingly predominate [38] . In recent case-control studies, at least one virus was detected in 87% of clinical pneumonia cases in South Africa [39] , while viruses were detected in 81% of radiologic pneumonia cases in Sweden [40] . In a large multi-center study in the United States, viral pathogens were detected in 73% of children hospitalized with radiologic pneumonia, while bacteria were detected in only 15% of cases [41] . A meta-analysis of 23 case-control studies of viral etiology in radiologically confirmed pneumonia in children, completed up to 2014, reported good evidence of causal attribution for respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, metapneumovirus and parainfluenza virus [42] . However there was no consistent evidence that many other commonly described viruses, including rhinovirus, adenovirus, bocavirus and coronavirus, were more commonly isolated from cases than from controls. Further attribution of bacterial etiology is difficult because it is often not possible to distinguish colonizing from pathogenic bacteria when they are isolated from nasal specimens [43] .\\n\\nAnother etiology is pertussis. In the last decade there has also been a resurgence in pertussis cases, especially in highincome countries [44] . Because pertussis immunity after acellular pertussis vaccination is less long-lasting than immunity after wild-type infection or whole-cell vaccination, many women of child-bearing age have waning pertussis antibody levels. Their infants might therefore be born with low transplacental anti-pertussis immunoglobulin G levels, making them susceptible to pertussis infection before completion of the primary vaccination series [45] . In 2014, more than 40,000 pertussis cases were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States; in some states, population-based incidence rates are higher than at any time in the last 70 years [44] . In contrast, most low-and middleincome countries use whole-cell pertussis vaccines and the numbers of pertussis cases in those countries were stable or decreasing until 2015 [46] . However recent evidence from South Africa (where the acellular vaccine is used) shows an appreciable incidence of pertussis among infants presenting with acute pneumonia: 2% of clinical pneumonia cases among infants enrolled in a birth cohort were caused by pertussis [39] , and 3.7% of infants and young children presenting to a tertiary academic hospital had evidence of pertussis infection [47] .\\n\\nSimilarly, childhood tuberculosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in many low-and middle-income countries, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis has increasingly been recognized as a pathogen in acute pneumonia in children living in high tuberculosis-prevalence settings. Postmortem studies of children dying from acute respiratory illness have commonly reported M. tuberculosis [48, 49] . A recent systematic review of tuberculosis as a comorbidity of childhood pneumonia reported culture-confirmed disease in about 8% of cases [50] . Because intrathoracic tuberculosis disease is only culture-confirmed in a minority of cases, the true burden could be even higher; tuberculosis could therefore be an important contributor to childhood pneumonia incidence and mortality in high-prevalence areas.\\n\\nChildhood pneumonia and clinically severe disease result from a complex interaction of host and environmental risk factors [37] . Because of the effectiveness of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination and Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccination for prevention of radiologic and clinical pneumonia, incomplete or inadequate vaccination must be considered as a major preventable risk factor for childhood pneumonia. Other risk factors include low birth weight, which is associated with 3.2 times increased odds of severe pneumonia in low-and middle-income countries, and 1.8 times increased odds in high-income countries [51] . Similarly, lack of exclusive breastfeeding for the first 4 months of life increases odds of severe pneumonia by 2.7 times in low-and middle-income countries and 1.3 times in highincome countries. Markers of undernutrition are strong risk factors for pneumonia in low-and middle-income countries only, with highly significant odds ratios for underweight for age (4.5), stunting (2.6) and wasting (2.8) . Household crowding has uniform risk, with odds ratios between 1.9 and 2.3 in both low-and middle-income countries and high-income countries. Indoor air pollution from use of solid or biomass fuels increases odds of pneumonia by 1.6 times; lack of measles vaccination by the end of the first year of age increases odds of pneumonia by 1.8 times [51] . It is estimated that the prevalence of these critical risk factors in low-and middle-income countries decreased by 25% between 2000 and 2010, contributing to reductions in pneumonia incidence and mortality in low-and middle-income countries, even in countries where conjugate vaccines have not been available [3] .\\n\\nThe single strongest risk factor for pneumonia is HIV infection, which is especially prevalent in children in sub-Saharan Africa. HIV-infected children have 6 times increased odds of developing severe pneumonia or of death compared to HIV-uninfected children [52] . Since the effective prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV, there is a growing population of HIV-exposed children who are uninfected; their excess risk of pneumonia, compared to HIV unexposed children, has been described as 1.3-to 3.4-fold higher [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] .\\n\\nThe pneumococcal conjugate vaccination and Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccination have been effective tools to decrease pneumonia incidence, severity and mortality [58, 59] . However, equitable coverage and access to vaccines remains sub-optimal. By the end of 2015, Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccination had been introduced in 73 countries, with global coverage estimated at 68%. However, inequities are still apparent among regions: in the Americas coverage is estimated at 90%, while in the Western Pacific it is only 25%. By 2015, pneumococcal conjugate vaccination had been introduced into 54 countries, with global coverage of 35% for three doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination for infant populations [60] . To address this issue, the WHO\\'s Global Vaccine Access Plan initiative was launched to make life-saving vaccines more equitably available. In addition to securing guarantees for financing of vaccines, the program objectives include building political will in low-and middle-income countries to commit to immunization as a priority, social marketing to individuals and communities, strengthening health systems and promoting relevant local research and development innovations [61] .\\n\\nMaternal vaccination to prevent disease in the youngest infants has been shown to be effective for tetanus, influenza and pertussis [62] . Influenza vaccination during pregnancy is safe, provides reasonable maternal protection against influenza, and also protects infants for a limited period from confirmed influenza infection (vaccine efficacy 63% in Bangladesh [63] and 50.4% in South Africa [64] ). However as antibody levels drop sharply after birth, infant protection does not persist much beyond 8 weeks [65] . Recently respiratory syncytial virus vaccination in pregnancy has been shown to be safe and immunogenic, and a phase-3 clinical trial of efficacy at preventing respiratory syncytial virus disease in infants is under way [66] . Within a decade, respiratory syncytial virus in infancy might be vaccine-preventable, with further decreases in pneumonia incidence, morbidity and mortality [67] .\\n\\nImproved access to health care, better nutrition and improved living conditions might contribute to further decreases in childhood pneumonia burden. The WHO Integrated Global Action Plan for diarrhea and pneumonia highlights many opportunities to protect, prevent and treat children [68] . Breastfeeding rates can be improved by programs that combine education and counseling interventions in homes, communities and health facilities, and by promotion of baby-friendly hospitals [69] . Improved home ventilation, cleaner cooking fuels and reduction in exposure to cigarette smoke are essential interventions to reduce the incidence and severity of pneumonia [70, 71] . Prevention of pediatric HIV is possible by providing interventions to prevent mother-to-child transmission [72] . Early infant HIV testing and early initiation of antiretroviral therapy and cotrimoxazole prophylaxis can substantially reduce the incidence of community-acquired pneumonia among HIV-infected children [73] . Community-based interventions reduce pneumonia mortality and have the indirect effect of improved-careseeking behavior [58] . If these cost-effective interventions were scaled up, it is estimated that 67% of pneumonia deaths in lowand middle-income countries could be prevented by 2025 [58] .\\n\\nCase management of pneumonia is a strategy by which severity of disease is classified as severe or non-severe. All children receive early, appropriate oral antibiotics, and severe cases are referred for parenteral antibiotics. When implemented in highburden areas before the availability of conjugate vaccines, case management as part of Integrated Management of Childhood Illness was associated with a 27% decrease in overall child mortality, and 42% decrease in pneumonia-specific mortality [74] . However the predominance of viral causes of pneumonia and low case fatality have prompted concern about overuse of antibiotics. Several randomized controlled trials comparing oral antibiotics to placebo for non-severe pneumonia have been performed [75] [76] [77] and others are ongoing [78] . In two studies, performed in Denmark and in India, outcomes of antibiotic and placebo treatments were equivalent [76, 77] . In the third study, in Pakistan, there was a non-significant 24% vs. 20% rate of failure in the placebo group, which was deemed to be non-equivalent to the antibiotic group [75] . Furthermore, because WHO-classified non-severe pneumonia and bronchiolitis might be considered within a spectrum of lower respiratory disease, many children with clinical pneumonia could actually have viral bronchiolitis, for which antibiotics are not beneficial [79] . This has been reflected in British [33] and Spanish [31] national pneumonia guidelines, which do not recommend routine antibiotic treatment for children younger than 2 years with evidence of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination who present with non-severe pneumonia. The United States\\' national guidelines recommend withholding antibiotics in children up to age 5 years presenting with non-severe pneumonia [32] . However, given the high mortality from pneumonia in low-and middle-income countries, the lack of easy access to care, and the high prevalence of risk factors for severe disease, revised World Health Organization pneumonia guidelines still recommend antibiotic treatment for all children who meet the WHO pneumonia case definitions [80] .\\n\\nUse of supplemental oxygen is life-saving, but this is not universally available in low-and middle-income countries; it is estimated that use of supplemental oxygen systems could reduce mortality of children with hypoxic pneumonia by 20% [81] . Identifying systems capacity to increase availability of oxygen in health facilities, and identifying barriers to further implementation are among the top 15 priorities for future childhood pneumonia research [82] . However, up to 81% of pneumonia deaths in 2010 occurred outside health facilities [5] , so there are major challenges with access to health services and health-seeking behavior of vulnerable populations. Identifying and changing the barriers to accessing health care is an important area with the potential to impact the survival and health of the most vulnerable children [82] .\\n\\nMuch progress has been made in decreasing deaths caused by childhood pneumonia. Improved socioeconomic status and vaccinations, primarily the conjugate vaccines (against Haemophilus influenzae and pneumococcus), have led to substantial reductions in the incidence and severity of childhood pneumonia. Stronger strategies to prevent and manage HIV have reduced HIV-associated pneumonia deaths. However, despite the substantial changes in incidence, etiology and radiology globally, there remain inequities in access to care and availability of effective interventions, especially in low-and middle-income countries. Effective interventions need to be more widely available and new interventions developed for the residual burden of childhood pneumonia.'}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'a23937a64fde47a54b9ed351b65bafef'}>,\n",

The ability to contain its spread in chickens would reduce this threat and help maintain the capacity for egg-based vaccine production. While vaccines offer the potential to control avian disease, a major concern of current vaccines is their potency and inability to protect against evolving avian influenza viruses. METHODOLOGY / PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The ability of DNA vaccines encoding hemagglutinin (HA) proteins from different HPAI H5N1 serotypes was evaluated for its ability to elicit neutralizing antibodies and to protect against homologous and heterologous HPAI H5N1 strain challenge in mice and chickens after DNA immunization by needle and syringe or with a pressure injection device. These vaccines elicited antibodies that neutralized multiple strains of HPAI H5N1 when given in combinations containing up to 10 HAs. The response was dose-dependent, and breadth was determined by the choice of the influenza virus HA in the vaccine. Monovalent and trivalent HA vaccines were tested first in mice and conferred protection against lethal H5N1 A/Vietnam/1203/2004 challenge 68 weeks after vaccination. In chickens, protection was observed against heterologous strains of HPAI H5N1 after vaccination with a trivalent H5 serotype DNA vaccine with doses as low as 5 µg DNA given twice either by intramuscular needle injection or with a needle-free device. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: DNA vaccines offer a generic approach to influenza virus immunization applicable to multiple animal species. In addition, the ability to substitute plasmids encoding different strains enables rapid adaptation of the vaccine to newly evolving field isolates.\\n\\nText: The highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus causes lethal multi-organ disease in poultry, resulting in significant economic losses and a public health concern in many parts of the world. The greatest threats posed by this virus are its ability to cause mortality in humans, its potential to compromise food supplies, and its possible economic impacts. Viral maintenance in poultry potentiates the risk of human-to-human transmission and the emergence of a pandemic strain through reassortment. An effective, safe poultry vaccine that elicits broadly protective immune responses to evolving flu strains would provide a countermeasure to reduce the likelihood of transmission of this virus from domestic birds to humans and simultaneously would protect commercial poultry operations and subsistence farmers.\\n\\nDNA vaccines have been shown to elicit robust immune responses in various animal species, from mice to nonhuman primates [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . In human trials, these vaccines elicit cellular and humoral immune responses against various infectious agents, including influenza, SARS, SIV and HIV. In addition to their ability to elicit antibody responses, they also stimulate antigenspecific and sustained T cell responses [1] [2] [3] 6, 12, 13] . DNA vaccination has been used experimentally against various infectious agents in a variety of mammals, including cattle (against infectious bovine rhinotracheitis/bovine diarrhea virus, leptospirosis and mycobacteriosis) [14, 15] , pigs (against classical swine fever virus and mycoplasmosis) [16] , and horses (against West Nile virus and rabies) [17] . In addition, DNA vaccines have been tested against avian plasmodium infection in penguins [18] and against influenza and infectious bursal disease in chickens [7, 8, 19] , duck hepatitis B virus in ducks [6] , and avian metapneumovirus and Chlamydia psittaci in turkeys [20, 21] (reviewed in ref. [22] ). While they have been used in chickens to generate antisera to specific influenza viruses and confer protection against the low pathogenicity H5N2 strain [23] , there is only one previous report of a monovalent DNA vaccine effective against H5N1 (and that only against a matched H5N1 isolate) [24] ; no protection with multivalent DNA vaccines against heterologous strains has been reported.\\n\\nDevelopment and characterization of a DNA vaccine modality for use in poultry offers a potential countermeasure against HPAI H5N1 avian influenza outbreaks. The virus can infect humans, typically from animal sources, including commercial and wild avian species, livestock, and possibly other non-domesticated animal species [25] [26] [27] . While there is marked diversity in the host range of type A influenza viruses, many experts have speculated that a pandemic strain of type A influenza could evolve in avian species or avian influenza viruses could contribute virulent genes to a pandemic strain through reassortment [28, 29] . Thus, there is reason to consider vaccination of poultry that would stimulate potent and broad protective immune responses [7, 30, 31] . In undertaking such efforts, it is important that there be a differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals [32] so that animals can be protected and permit monitoring of new infections using proven and sensitive methodologies.\\n\\nIn this study, we used an automated high capacity needle-free injection device, Agro-JetH (Medical International Technology, Inc., Denver, CO) to explore the feasibility of DNA vaccination of poultry. After optimization of injection conditions, alternative multivalent DNA vaccine regimens were analyzed and compared for magnitude and breadth of neutralizing antibodies, as well as protective efficacy after challenge in mouse and chicken models of HPAI H5N1 infection. The findings suggest that it is possible to develop a multivalent DNA vaccine for poultry that can protect against multiple HPAI H5N1 strains and that could keep pace with the continued evolution of avian influenza viruses.\\n\\nImmunogenicity and neutralizing antibody specificity of alternative HA DNA vaccines in mice To evaluate the efficacy of multivalent DNA vaccines, initial studies were performed in mice. Expression vectors encoding HAs from ten phylogenetically diverse strains of influenza viruses [33] were generated by synthesis of cDNAs (see Materials and Methods) in plasmid expression vectors, pCMV/R or pCMV/R 8kB, which mediates high level expression and immunogenicity in vivo [34, 35, 36] . Animals were immunized with each expression vector intramuscularly (IM) at three week intervals, and the antisera were evaluated on day 14 after the third immunization for their ability to neutralize HPAI H5N1 pseudotyped lentiviral vectors as previously described [35, 36] . We have previously shown that lentiviral assay inhibition (LAI) yields similar results to microneutralization and HAI analyses with higher sensitivity in mice [35, 36] \\n\\nTo determine whether immunization with multiple HAs simultaneously could expand the breadth of the neutralizing antibody response without significant loss of magnitude, a combination of 10 HA DNA vaccine immunogens was administered IM at proportionally lower concentration (1.5 mg per immunogen) into groups of 10 mice (see Materials and Methods). Remarkably, despite a log lower DNA concentration of each component, significant neutralizing antibody titers were generated to each of the 10 immunogens, with .80% neutralization against 6 out of 12 H5 HA pseudoviruses at dilutions of up to 1:400 ( Fig. 2A) .\\n\\nTo evaluate whether similar breadth of immunity could be generated with fewer immunogens, two different combinations of 5 immunogens were selected, based on the phylogenetic diversity of HA among the avian influenza viruses [33] and the crossreactivity of the neutralizing antibody responses of select individual immunogens (Fig. 1 ). As expected, there were substantial differences in the breadth of neutralization between these two sets of 5 immunogen multivalent vaccines (Fig. 2 , B vs. C). In one set, while neutralization of homologous strains was comparable to the monovalent and the 10 immunogen multivalent immune response, fewer cross-reactive antibodies were detected, directed most prominently against A/Iraq Protection of DNA-vaccinated mice against challenge with heterologous H5N1 A/Vietnam/1203/2004 influenza virus Mice immunized as described above were challenged with a heterologous H5N1 virus 68 weeks after the final DNA vaccination. Animals were then challenged with 10 LD 50 of the highly pathogenic A/Vietnam/1203/2004 virus intranasally, and morbidity and mortality were monitored for 21 days after the viral challenge. The control animals, injected with the plasmid expression vector with no insert, died within 10 days of infection. Complete survival was observed in the groups immunized with the 10 component and set 2 of the 5 component multivalent DNA vaccines (Fig. 3) . Immunization with HA derived from the A/ Indonesia/05/2005 strain or set 1 of the 5 component multivalent DNA vaccine showed a survival rate approaching 90%. In contrast, animals injected with HA plasmid DNA derived from A/ Anhui/1/2005, which has diverged more from A/Vietnam/ 1203/2004, showed a lower percent survival (70%) after lethal viral challenge. Survival differences between groups were assessed using a log-rank test and the Gehan-Wilcoxon test on the survival curves for pairs of groups. A test was deemed significant if the pvalue was ,0.01. Mice injected IM with different HAs, A/ Indonesia/5/05, A/Anhui/1/05, 10HA, 5 HA (Set 1), or 5 HA (Set 2) showed a significant difference compared to control (all p values,0.001). Among the HA-immunized groups, there was no significant difference between any two groups (p.0.08 for all comparisons). For example, no significant difference was observed between the A/Anhui/1/05 group, which had the least survival among the HA immunized groups (7 out of 10), and other HA groups: A/Indonesia/5/05 (p = 0.377), 10 HA (p = 0.082), 5 HA (Set 1) (p = 0.101), or 5 HA (Set 2) (p = .411). Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that the 3 deaths in the A/Anhui/1/05 group may have been due to random chance.\\n\\nSince it is desirable to confer protective immunity in poultry and HA DNA vaccination was effective in mice, we next examined the breadth and potency of single or multiple HA plasmid immunization in chickens. The ability of chickens to generate specific antibodies was assessed with three strains that showed broad cross protection in mouse studies (A/Vietnam/1203/2004, A/Anhui/ 1/2005 and A/Indonesia/05/2005), administered individually or in combination, by different injection methods. In addition to needle injection, a needle-free repetitive injection device, Agro-JetH (Medical International Technology, Inc., Denver, CO), was analyzed. This device disperses the 0.1 to 5 ml injection doses into the dermal, subcutaneous, or intramuscular tissue depending upon the pressure adjustments, powered by a CO 2 gas pressure plunger [39] . The injection conditions were determined by histologic analysis of tissues that received injections of India ink; a pressure of 48 psi was chosen since it enabled consistent delivery into intradermal and subcutaneous tissues (Fig. S1 ).\\n\\nImmunization of chickens with the control plasmid (CMV/R) without an HA gene insert elicited minimal neutralizing antibody titers compared to HA-immunized animals 1 week after 3 DNA immunizations. Nearly all chickens immunized with either monovalent or multivalent HA DNA vaccines generated significant neutralization titers ( Fig. 4 and Table S1 ). In general, there was a progressive increase in the amount of neutralization after each successive DNA vaccination (data not shown) with maximal response at 1 week after the 3 rd DNA immunization, with highest and most consistent levels in the trivalent vaccine group delivered with the Agro-JetH device. Neutralization of the Indonesia HA strain was the most robust, with neutralization nearing 100% at titers greater than 1:3200. Both the monovalent and multivalent vaccines elicited robust homologous ( vaccine (Fig. 4 ). Even though one chicken (238) in the multivalent vaccine group produced almost the same degree of neutralization at each time point and was protected, it did not produce a high neutralizing antibody titer for reasons that were uncertain but possibly related to a non-specific inhibitor in the sera.\\n\\nTo determine whether chickens immunized with single or multiple DNA vaccines were protected from a lethal challenge of a heterologous HPAI H5N1 virus, vaccinated chickens were In panels B and C, mice (n = 10) were immunized with 15 mg of plasmid (3 mg each) three times at 3 week intervals. Serum pools from the immunized animals were collected 14 days after the third immunization. The antisera were tested against the 12 indicated pseudotyped lentiviral vectors at varying dilutions. Error bars at each point indicate the standard deviation; each sample was evaluated in triplicate. In general, the immunized serum neutralized all tested pseudotyped lentiviruses at low dilutions while differences were often observed at high dilution. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0002432.g002 inoculated with 20 LD 50 of highly pathogenic A/Vietnam/1203/ 2004 heterologous virus intranasally using standard methods [25, 40] and monitored for morbidity, mortality, viral shedding and serum antibodies. While all the control animals died within 2 days of infection, 100% survival was noted in the rest of the chickens (Fig. 5A ). The animals that were healthy, showing no signs of clinical disease or malaise, were euthanized on day 14. There was no evidence for viral shedding monitored via tracheal and cloacal swabs of infected chickens 2-14 days after challenge as determined by embryonal inoculation (data not shown: egg infectious dose 50 (EID 50 ) limit of detection ,100 virus particles).\\n\\nTo compare the relative efficacy of DNA vaccines delivered IM by needle and syringe versus the needle-free Agro-JetH device injection, a dose-response study was performed with amounts of DNA vaccine ranging from 500 to 0.5 mg with two inoculations. In these experiments, the HA derived from A/chicken/Nigeria/641/ 2006 was substituted for A/Vietnam/1203/2004 since it represented a more contemporary isolate. The observed rate of protection was higher among the animals receiving 5 mg by Agro-Jet (8/8) than by IM injection (6/8) (Fig. 5, B vs. C). Both modes provided complete protection for all animals at doses higher than this, and 25% protection for the animals receiving 0.5 mg doses (Fig. 5B, C) . Survival differences between consecutive doses were assessed using a log-rank test on the survival curves for pairs of groups. A test was deemed significant if the p-value was ,.01, and marginally significant if the p-value was ,.05 but ..01. Chickens injected IM showed a marginally significant difference between 0.5 and 5 mg (p = .047). In the same group there was a significant difference between control and 5, 50 and 500 mg (p,.001 for all comparisons) and the difference between control and 0.5 mg was marginally significant (p = .016). Chickens that were injected using Agro-JetH showed a significant difference between 0.5 and 5 mg (p = .004) and between control and 5, 50, and 500 mg (p,.001 for all comparisons). There were no differences between control and 0.5 mg or between 5, 50, and 500 mg. Lastly, the survival differences between Agro-JetH and IM for each dose group were not significant. The neutralizing antibody response to homologous and heterologous HAs corresponded with protection and correlated with dose, with higher titers elicited by injection with Agro-JetH compared to needle (Table S2) . We assessed viable viral shedding after inoculation by chick embryo inoculation three days after virus challenge (Week 8). While we noted some embryonic lethality at the 0.5 mg dose, there was no embryonic lethality at 5, 50 or 500 mg groups (data not shown).\\n\\nSince the HPAI H5N1 virus first appeared ten years ago, this highly pathogenic avian influenza virus has shown increasing diversification and dissemination in Asia, Africa, and Europe [28, [41] [42] [43] [44] . In addition to its effects on human health by crossspecies transmission [28, 45, 46] and ability to compromise food sources, it poses a continuing threat to public health as it evolves and adapts in different species. The pandemic potential of this virus, especially as it relates to the poultry industry and for reservoir avian hosts, underscores the need for a vaccine that offers broad spectrum immunity and protection against lethal viral challenge. While the virus remains restricted in its ability to infect humans and undergo efficient human-to-human transmission [28, 47] , its persistence and spread in poultry increases the risk of the emergence of a pandemic strain. One approach to pandemic risk reduction is to limit the propagation of the virus in poultry and other relevant avian species.\\n\\nWe have previously reported that DNA vaccines encoding HA can confer protection against a highly lethal human pandemic influenza virus, the 1918 H1N1 virus, in mice [36] . DNA vaccines offer several advantages, including the ability to express diverse antigens, tolerability in various hosts, ease of delivery, and stability for storage and distribution without the necessity of maintaining a cold chain; they have been shown to be safe and efficacious in a variety of animal models [2, 4, 12, 22, 48] . Because they do not contain other viral proteins used to screen for infection, they also address the need to differentiate vaccinated from infected animals. There is evidence that DNA vaccination elicits cell-mediated immunity against influenza HA in addition to inducing an antibody response [36] , an effect that could significantly contribute to protective immunity as viruses show genetic drift and reduced susceptibility to neutralization.\\n\\nIdeally, a highly effective influenza vaccine should not only be able to let the host develop a protective immune response against a matching live virus challenge but also elicit robust protective immune responses against a broad range of homologous and heterologous H5 influenza strains. A multivalent H5 vaccine containing diverse serotypes could expand the antigenic breadth sufficiently to provide protection against heterologous challenge and may preclude the emergence of vaccine-resistant strains that may arise due to evolutionary vaccine pressure on the virus. Due to the antigenic drift and shift of the influenza virus genome, it has been very difficult to predict the next dominant strain of an avian endemic outbreak. DNA vaccines can be synthesized in a relatively short period of time, and the targeted mutations can be tailored to specific viral serotypes. The mutations promote a focused and enhanced immune response [3, 49, 50] that may be particularly important in the event of an outbreak where specificity is the key to epidemic control. The use of modified codons ensures maximal expression in the host and eliminates the possibility of recombination with influenza viruses that might potentially generate new strains.\\n\\nA more broadly protective murine vaccine was developed here by including more HAs from varying strains in the multivalent vaccine (Figs. 2 and 3) . However, it is less practical to include large numbers of different HAs in one vaccine due to the cost and complexity of manufacturing such a vaccine. Therefore, we simplified the vaccine regimen based on cross-neutralization studies and phylogenetic relationships. A trivalent vaccine was subsequently identified for further studies. Due [51] .\\n\\nWhile three DNA immunizations were used initially to demonstrate protective immunity and have been used previously to elicit protection in mice [36] , we found that effective protective immunity could be induced with two DNA vaccinations and as little as 5 mg trivalent DNA immunization using the ID/SC route with the Agro-JetH device. In addition, based on the chick embryo inoculation data, we believe that there is effective neutralization of the virus and lack of infectious viral shedding in chicken vaccinated with as little as 5 mg of DNA. The device's capacity for rapid repetitive injection and the lower quantity and stability of DNA enhance the practicality and utility of this approach for vaccination of endangered species in captivity or administration to poultry or other animals.\\n\\nA/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) (A/VN/1203/04) was obtained from the repository at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, Georgia. The virus was propagated in 10-day old embryonated chicken eggs at 35uC and stored at 270uC until use. The virus was titrated by the Reed and Muench method to determine EID 50 [52] . GenBank ABD28180) were synthesized using human-preferred codons (GeneArt, Regensburg, Germany) [36] . HA cDNAs from diverse strains of influenza viruses were then inserted into plasmid expression vectors, pCMV/R or pCMV/R 8kB, which mediates high level expression and immunogenicity in vivo [34, 35, 36] . For initial trivalent immunizations in chickens, the A/Vietnam/1203/ 2004, A/Anhui/1/2005 and A/Indonesia/05/2005 strains were used and in the dose response study, the Vietnam strain was replaced with A/chicken/Nigeria/641/2006. The immunogens used in DNA vaccination contained a cleavage site mutation (PQRERRRKKRG to PQRETRG) as previously described [35, 36] . This mutation was generated by site-directed mutagenesis using a QuickChange kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA).\\n\\nDNA immunization of mice [6] [7] [8] week old female BALB/c mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory and maintained in the AAALAC-accredited Vaccine Research Center Animal Care Facility (Bethesda, MD) under specific pathogen-free conditions. All experiments were approved by the Vaccine Research Center Animal Care and Use Committee. The mice were immunized as previously described [5] . Briefly, mice (10 animals for all test groups, 20 animals for the\\n\\nThe study was carried out in the AAALAC-accredited animal facility at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Six groups of 8 one-day-old male and female SPAFAS White Leghorn Chickens, Gallus domesticus, were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Connecticut). The animals were housed in brooder and grower cages (McMurray Hatcheries, Iowa). Feed (Teklad Japanese Quail Diet -3050, Harlan-Teklad, WI) and water were provided to the animals ad libitum. The study was performed in strict accordance with the ''Guide'' after approvals from the Animal Care and Use Committees of the Vaccine Research Center, NIH and the University of Maryland. DNA immunizations were performed as described at 0, 3 and 6 weeks. A total dose of 500 mg of one or a combination of the following DNA plasmids in a volume of 250 ml was administered to each animal: pCMV/ R, pCMV/R-HA \\n\\nAgro-JetH is a needle-free device used for mass delivery of vaccines and drugs in livestock and poultry. The device is semiautomatic and requires a small CO 2 tank or compressed air for low pressure delivery. Upon trigger activation, CO 2 disperses the injectate at a precise dose into the muscle, dermis or subcutaneous tissue depending on the setting that was standardized for our use. We used an effective volume of 0.1 ml in our injectate [39] . In this study we were able to effectively deliver 0.1 ml of injectate into the animal's dermis/subcutaneous tissue at a pressure of 48-55 psi.\\n\\nSixty-eight weeks after the last immunization, female BALB/c mice were lightly anesthetized with Ketamine/Xylazine and inoculated intranasally with 10 LD 50 of A/Vietnam/1203/2004 virus diluted in phosphate-buffered saline in a 50 ul volume. Mice were monitored daily for morbidity and measured for weight loss and mortality for 21 days post infection. Any mouse that had lost more than 25% of its body weight was euthanized. All experiments involving the HPAI virus were conducted in an AAALAC accredited facility (BioQual Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) under BSL 3 conditions that included enhancements required by the USDA and the Select Agent Program.\\n\\nWhite Leghorn chickens were challenged one week after the last immunization with 20 lethal dose 50 (LD 50 ) of A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) influenza A virus, equivalent to 2610 4 EID 50 based on previous challenges [53] . Chickens were infected with 200 ml virus intranasally. Tracheal and cloacal swabs were collected days 3 and 5 post-challenge and stored in glass vials containing BHI medium (BBL TM Brain Heart Infusion, Becton Dickinson) at 280uC. Blood was collected 14 days post-challenge and serum was titered by microneutralization assay. Chickens were observed and scored daily for clinical signs of infection, morbidity and mortality. Chickens that survived the study were bled and humanely euthanized at day 14 post-challenge. Lungs, heart, intestine and kidney were collected and samples were stored in formalin for histopathology. Experiments were carried out under BSL3+ conditions with investigators wearing appropriate protective equipment and compliant with all Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee-approved protocols and under Animal Welfare Act regulations at the University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland.\\n\\nRepresentative tracheal and cloacal swabs were chosen to run an EID 50 assay for comparison and virus titers were determine by the method of Reed and Meunch [52] . Briefly, swabs were used to infect 10 day-old embryonated chicken eggs in 10-fold dilutions. Three eggs were inoculated per dilution and incubated for 48 hours before titration.\\n\\nNeutralizing antibodies were titrated from serum samples collected week 5 and 7 post-vaccination and day 14 post-challenge. The microneutralization assay was performed using a 96-well plate format. Serum was treated with receptor-destroying enzyme (Denka Seiken Co.) and treated at 37uC per the manufacturer's instructions. After an overnight incubation and subsequent inactivation samples were brought to a final dilution of 1:10 using PBS and each sample was serially diluted and virus, diluted to 100 TCID 50 , was added to each well. The plates were then incubated at 37uC, 5% CO 2 for 1-2 hours. Following incubation, supernatants were used to infect a second 96-well plate of MDCK cells. Microplates were incubated at 4uC for 15 minutes and then 37uC, 5% CO 2 for 45 minutes. Supernatants of serum and virus were then discarded and 200 ml of OptiMEM (containing 1X antibiotics/antimycotics, 1 mg/ml TPCK-trypsin) was added and incubated at 37uC, 5% CO 2 for 3 days. After 3 days, 50 ml of the supernatant from each well was transferred into a new 96-well microplate, and an HA assay was performed to calculate the antibody titers. Virus and cell controls were included in the assay.\\n\\nTwo-fold dilutions of heat-inactivated sera were tested in a microneutralization assay as previously described [54] for the presence of antibodies that neutralized the infectivity of 100 TCID 50 (50% tissue culture infectious dose) of the A/Vietnam/ 1203/2004 H5N1 virus on MDCK cell monolayers by using two wells per dilution on a 96-well plate.\\n\\nThe recombinant lentiviral vectors expressing a luciferase reporter gene were produced as previously described [35, 36] . For the neutralization assay, antisera from immunized animals were heat-inactivated at 55uC for 30 minutes and mixed with 50 ml of pseudovirus at various dilutions. The sera/virus mixture was then added to 293A cells in 96-well B&W TC Isoplates (Wallac, Turku, Finland; 12,000 cells/well). Two hours later, the plates were washed and fresh medium was added. Cells were lysed in mammalian cell lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) 24 hrs after infection and luciferase activity was measured using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI).\\n\\nThe following strains were used for the production of pseudotyped viruses: for HA we used A/Thailand/1(KAN- \\n\\nThe HA/HI titers were determined as previously described [54] . Briefly, HA titers were calculated using 50 ml of 0.5% chicken red blood cell suspension in PBS added to 50 ml of twofold dilutions of virus in PBS. This mix was incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. The HA titers were calculated as the reciprocal value of the highest dilution that caused complete hemagglutination. HI titers were calculated by titrating 50 ml of antiserum treated with receptor-destroying enzyme and an equivalent amount of A/Vietnam/1203/2004 virus (four hemagglutinating doses) was added to each well. Wells were incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes and 50 ml of a 0.5% suspension of chicken red blood cells was added. HI titers were calculated after 30 minutes as the reciprocal of the serum dilution that inhibited hemagglutination.\\n\\nTable S1 Hemagglutination inhibition (HI), microneutralization titer (NT), and LAI of sera from individual chickens immunized with different vaccines. Sera from immunized animals were obtained at week 5 or 7, a week before or after the final boost, and neutralization was assessed by HI, microneutralization (NT) and LAI (shown as IC 50 ). Individual animal serum of each group is shown and was analyzed as described in the Materials and Methods section. Figure S1 Characterization of needle-free (Agro-JetH) DNA immunization in chickens. To evaluate the distribution of fluid into superficial or deep layers of subcutaneous tissues after delivery by AgroJetH, 4 or 7 week old chickens were injected with a solution containing India ink with this needle-free device at various pressures, ranging from 45 to 55 mm Hg. Three sites (thigh, wing and breast) were used, and biopsies were taken for routine hematoxylin and eosin staining. Representative sections of thigh injections are shown from 7 week old chickens and were similar at 4 weeks (data not shown). While the 48 mm Hg pressure deposited the injectate into the dermis/subcutaneous region (left), the higher pressure injections, 52 and 58 mm Hg, deposited the injectate into the subcutaneous and muscle layers (middle, right). 48 mm Hg consistently provided an optimal pressure to deposit the injectate into the dermis and subcutaneous tissue and was chosen for all AgroJetH immunizations.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study material consisted of 15 calves of different ages and sexes brought to the Training, Research and Application Center at the Kafkas University Faculty of Veterinary Medicine with suspected neonatal septicemia. 8.5 mL of blood was drawn from the jugular vein of each animal into coagulant tubes before and after treatment for one-off biochemical analyses and centrifuged. After this, the serum was separated. Hepcidin, TAS, TOS, and Fe levels in the serum were measured. RESULTS: While pre-treatment hepcidin levels were 58.42±3.46 ng/mL, post-treatment levels were 46.87±2.98 ng/mL (p<0.05). Pre-treatment Fe levels were 60.13±7.27 µg/dl, while post-treatment levels were 83.1±8.09 µg/dl (p<0.05). The changes in the TAS and TOS levels were also found to be statistically significant. CONCLUSION: In light of the fact that hepcidin plays a role function in the regulation of Fe as well as the fact that Fe is a significant nutritional source for many microorganisms, it was concluded that hepcidin may play a significant role in nutritional immunity and the pathogenesis of diseases.\\n\\nText: Neonatal calf septicemia causes high morbidity and mortality and is one of the leading and most significant difficulties in raising cattle. Calf septicemia is the main cause of death in the neonatal period [1] . Its etiology involves bacteria (commonly Escherichia coli), viruses (rota and coronavirus), parasites, and other factors. As the disease progresses quickly and is lethal, diagnosis and treatment should be initiated as quickly as possible [2] .\\n\\nHepcidin is a low molecular weight, antimicrobial peptide hormone and was first discovered in human urine [3] . It is produced by the liver as a firstline response to inflammatory reactions and high Fe concentrations [4, 5] . Hepcidin plays a fundamental role in the regulation of Fe metabolism [6] , which is a part of foundational cellular functions and thus of vital importance. On the other hand, by participating in redox reactions leading to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROSs), Fe also causes oxidative stress. Therefore, Fe has been regarded as a potentially toxic element to cells [7] . Fe also plays an important role in pathogenesis of bacterial infections as bacteria utilize Fe for survival, growth and proliferation; therefore, it is of paramount importance to control the Fe metabolism [6] . It is well known that the abundance of Fe suppresses defense system leading host vulnerable to infections. There is a significant relationship between Hepcidin, Fe metabolism, inflammation, and the immune system. The fact that hepcidin plays an active role in the regulation of Fe release from macrophages and in the control of excessive Fe absorption from the duodenum is well documented [6] . Hepcidin is a part of the natural defense mechanism, thus it limits the amount of Fe that can be utilized by pathogens [8] . In inflammatory conditions, hypoferremia is an important first-line protective mechanism in response to infections [9] . Fe also participates in redox reactions, causing the production of ROS, and thus leading to oxidative stress [7] . Free radicals play a significant role in the pathogenesis of many diseases [10] . Newborns are subject to oxidative stress during birth. It is also reported that in livestock diseases, especially enteritis and pneumonia, antioxidant capacity is efficacious [11] .\\n\\nThis study was designed to determine the clinical significance of hepcidin in calves with suspected neonatal septicemia by evaluating serum hepcidin, total antioxidant status (TAS), total oxidant status (TOS), and Fe levels in calves suspected of neonatal septicemia before and after treatment.\\n\\nThis study was conducted after obtaining approval from the Mehmet Akif Ersoy University Animal Experiments Local Ethics Committee (MAKU-HADYEK-Submission: 2014/77).\\n\\nThe study consisted of 15 calves with suspected neonatal septicemia aged between 1 and 10 days old admitted to the Teaching Hospital of Veterinary Medicine. Suspected septicemia was diagnosed based on clinical (diarrhea, weakness in or absence of sucking reflex, the calf being in a supine position on the ground or being unable to stand, severe dehydration, abnormal rectal temperature [hypo-or hyperthermia], mucosal hyperemia, and full sclera) and hematological (increase in white blood cell [WBC] count) examinations; the animals were suspected to have septicemia [12, 13] . The animals were given standard treatment (antibiotic, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, vitamin C, fluid therapy, and intestinal astringent). For determination of serum hepcidin, TAS, TOS, Fe levels, and hematological parameters; blood samples were taken before and after treatment in all cases. 8.5 mL of blood was taken from the jugular vein of each animal into coagulant tubes for biochemical analysis, and 3 mL blood was taken into ETDA tubes for hematological analysis. Samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min, and the serum was harvested and kept at −20°C until the analysis. Serum hepcidin (Mybiosource ® ), TAS (Rel Assay Diagnostics ® ), and TOS (Rel Assay Diagnostics ® ) were determined using commercial ELISA kits, and Fe value was measured spectrophotometrically. Hematological (WBC, lymphocyte [LYM], red blood cells [RBC], mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and hematocrit [HCT]) analysis was performed on blood counter (VG-MS4e ® , Melet Schloesıng, France).\\n\\nThe results were evaluated using the t-test in the SPSS ® (SPSS 20, USA) statistical package program to determine the differences between values before and after treatment.\\n\\nCalves with suspected septicemia exhibited clinical signs of loss of appetite, fatigue, indifference to surroundings, reduced/absence of sucking reflex, cool extremities, inability to stand, diarrhea, eye sinking into their sockets, and hyperemia in the conjunctiva. The average body temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rates of the animals were 37.18±0.13°C, 104±4.33/min, and 28.86±0.75/min pre-treatment; and 38.54±0.1°C, 107.53±2.20/min and 26.40±0.36/min post-treatment, respectively.\\n\\nThe changes in hepcidin, TAS, TOS and Fe levels in the calves with suspected septicemia before and after treatment are given in Table- 1. After treatment, serum hepcidin and TOS levels were significantly lower than before treatment in calves. On contrary, serum TAS and Fe levels were significantly higher than before treatment (Table-1 ).\\n\\nThe treatment of calves resulted in significant changes in the hematological parameters that were examined except for RBC. The WBC count, LYM count, MCV and HCT significantly changed after treatment when compared to values obtained before treatment (Table-2 ).\\n\\nThis study aimed to determine the clinical importance or use of hepcidin by comparing the values of serum hepcidin, TAS, TOS and Fe levels in calves with suspected neonatal septicemia before and after treatment.\\n\\nClinicians rely on clinical and laboratory examinations of patients to form a working diagnosis, so hematological and serum biochemical parameters are usually used for this purpose [14] . The hematological parameters (WBC, HCT, LYM, and MCV) evaluated in this study were comparable with those reported by others in neonatal calves with diarrhea and suspected septicemia [15] [16] [17] . Treatment significantly corrected to normal values the hematological parameters that were examined with the exception of RBC. Pretreatment leukocyte count was high because of the inflammation that occurred in the organism, and that the HCT levels were high due to the dehydration that occurred due to diarrhea. Hepcidin is controlled by the presence of inflammation in the body, Fe storage, and erythropoietic activity in the bone marrow and plays a primary role in the homeostasis of Fe [4] . The increase in tissue and plasma Fe levels stimulates the synthesis of hepcidin and reduces Fe release and enteric Fe absorption from macrophages and hepatocytes [18] . Increased hepcidin concentrations during inflammation and infection reduce serum Fe levels by decreasing Fe release from macrophages and hepatocytes, and thus Fe required for microorganisms and tumor cells is restricted [19] .\\n\\nSerum hepcidin levels in calves with suspected septicemia were significantly high before treatment when compared to after treatment; also Fe levels were lower before treatment when compared to after treatment in this study. This situation could be related to the interaction between hepcidin and Fe and also gives credence to the role of hepcidin in the hemostasis of Fe during inflammation and infection. As in our study, Fe levels are well known to decrease in diarrheic calves when compared to healthy calves [20, 21] . Although no study exists reporting hepcidin concentration in diseased calves, studies in human subjects show that cord blood hepcidin levels might be an important indicator in diagnosing early-onset of neonatal sepsis. The cord blood hepcidin levels of neonatal infants with sepsis varied between 118.1 and 8400 ng/mL and were significantly higher than the healthy infants [22] . A similar result was reported that hepcidin concentrations in neonatal infants with sepsis were significantly higher than in healthy infants [23] . These findings along with our results add credence to the idea that hepcidin-Fe interaction may play a role in the pathogenesis of septicemia.\\n\\nThe production of free oxygen species causes alterations in protein, lipid, and DNA during oxidative stress and leads to the development of lesions in the organs [24] . Free iron has toxic characteristics as it catalyses the production of ROSs [25] and thus causes oxidative stress [26] . The role of Fe in the development of oxidative stress may once more show the importance of hepcidin, as an important Fe regulator, with regard to enhancing antioxidant capacity through inhibiting utilization of Fe by the organism as well as the host cells.\\n\\nThe antioxidant and oxidative system are in a constant state of balance in the organism. Any event breaking up this balance in favor of the oxidative stress molecules will cause cell damage [27, 28] . The host cells initiate the antioxidant system in case of exposure to oxidative stress [27] . Kabu et al. [16] reported TOS and TAS values in neonatal calves with diarrhea as 13.47±0.81 μmol H 2 O 2 /L and 0.51±0.02 mmol Trolox-equivalent/L, respectively, and treatment of these calves caused changes in these values of 11.21±0.26 μmol H 2 O 2 /L and 0.55±0.02 mmol Troloxequivalent/L, respectively. Studies also reported that parameters used for oxidative stress (malondialdehyde) were higher [29] and antioxidant parameters (superoxide dismutase [21] , TAS) were lower in diarrheic calves [29] . Similarly, in our study, TAS level was significantly lower and TOS level was significantly higher in diarrheic calves before treatment, and treatment caused corrections in these parameters. Decrease in TAS and increase in TOS levels demonstrated that oxidative stress was evident in the diseased calves in our study. Increased TOS and hepcidin levels before treatment are thought that associated with inflammation. After treatment increased TAS and decreased hepcidin levels support this opinion.\\n\\nHepcidin may play an important part in non-specific immunity and is a key molecule that plays a role in the pathogenesis of diseases by enhancing the development of antioxidant system. However, more detailed studies are needed on the role of hepcidin in the pathogenesis of septicemia.\\n\\nThis work was carried out in collaboration between all authors.

Furthermore, the ability of PCR/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS) to detect enteroviruses and rhinoviruses in respiratory samples has not been well evaluated. We sought to use PCR/ESI-MS to comprehensively investigate the viral epidemiology of adult RTIs, including testing for rhinoviruses and enteroviruses. Nasopharyngeal or throat swabs from 267 adults with acute RTIs (212 upper RTIs and 55 lower RTIs) who visited a local clinic or the outpatient or emergency departments of a medical center in Taiwan between October 2012 and June 2013 were tested for respiratory viruses by both virus isolation and PCR/ESI-MS. Throat swabs from 15 patients with bacterial infections and 27 individuals without active infections were included as control samples. Respiratory viruses were found in 23.6%, 47.2%, and 47.9% of the 267 cases by virus isolation, PCR/ESI-MS, and both methods, respectively. When both methods were used, the influenza A virus (24.3%) and rhinoviruses (9.4%) were the most frequently identified viruses, whereas human coronaviruses, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), enteroviruses, adenoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, and parainfluenza viruses were identified in small proportions of cases (<5% of cases for each type of virus). Coinfection was observed in 4.1% of cases. In the control group, only 1 (2.4%) sample tested positive for a respiratory virus by PCR/ESI-MS. Patients who were undergoing steroid treatment, had an active malignancy, or suffered from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were at risk for rhinovirus, hMPV, or parainfluenza infections, respectively. Overall, immunocompromised patients, patients with COPD, and patients receiving dialysis were at risk for noninfluenza respiratory virus infection. Rhinoviruses (12.7%), influenza A virus (10.9%), and parainfluenza viruses (7.3%) were the most common viruses involved in the 55 cases of lower RTIs. The factors of parainfluenza infection, old age, and immunosuppression were independently associated with lower RTIs. In conclusion, PCR/ESI-MS improved the diagnostic yield for viral RTIs. Non-influenza respiratory virus infections were associated with patients with comorbidities and with lower RTIs. Additional studies that delineate the clinical need for including non-influenza respiratory viruses in the diagnostic work-up in these populations are warranted.\\n\\nText: V iral respiratory tract infections (RTIs) in humans occur throughout the year and represent a major cause of clinical visits worldwide. In the past, the viral causes of RTIs were largely unknown, primarily due to the insensitivity of culturebased methods for the detection of viruses or to the narrow spectrum of viral detection using singleplex nucleic acid tests (NATs). Recently, the development of multiplex respiratory NATs has allowed for the simultaneous, rapid, and sensitive detection of multiple viruses, which facilitates comprehensive studies regarding the epidemiology of viral RTIs. Currently, the viral epidemiology of RTIs has been studied more extensively among pediatric populations compared with adult populations throughout the world. 1 Similarly, most studies describing the viral etiology of respiratory illness in Taiwan, a subtropical country in Eastern Asia, were limited to pediatric populations. [2] [3] [4] Thus, studies among adult patients are lacking, particularly regarding infections due to fastidious or newly identified viruses, such as human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and human coronavirus (hCoV). Overlapping clinical presentations shared by different respiratory viruses make differential diagnoses difficult to perform based solely on the clinical parameters. 5 Moreover, effective antiviral agents are currently restricted to influenza virus infections. Hence, a better understanding of the epidemiology of adult viral RTIs would aid the future design of diagnostic strategies, infection control, and patient management.\\n\\nAmong the various multiplex NATs, multilocus polymerase chain reaction coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS) can simultaneously identify and subtype multiple respiratory viruses. [6] [7] [8] [9] Despite the diagnostic potential, the ability of PCR/ESI-MS to detect human enterovirus and rhinovirus in respiratory samples from patients with RTIs has not been well evaluated. Previous PCR/ESI-MS studies in patients with RTIs did not include these 2 viruses in the diagnostic panels. [6] [7] [8] [9] Here, we expanded upon these previous studies utilizing PCR/ESI-MS for respiratory virus detection. We aimed to comprehensively investigate the epidemiology of adult viral RTIs using PCR/ESI-MS and compare the diagnostic performance between PCR/ESI-MS and conventional culture methods for identifying multiple, clinically relevant, respiratory viruses, including enterovirus and rhinovirus.\\n\\nTo conduct a comprehensive epidemiologic study that included patients with and without comorbidity, we enrolled adults (of at least 18 yr of age) with acute RTIs within 7 days of onset who were treated at a local outpatient clinic of YC hospital or the outpatient or emergency departments of National Cheng-Kung University Hospital (NCKUH), a university-affiliated medical center in southern Taiwan, between October 2012 and June 2013. Acute RTI was defined as the simultaneous occurrence of at least 1 respiratory symptom or sign (new or worsening cough, sputum production, sore throat, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, dyspnea, wheezing, or injected tonsils) and at least 1 of the following symptoms: fever, chills, and cough. Lower RTI (LRTI) was defined as the presence of acute RTI and a new infiltrate on chest radiograph. For patients experiencing more than 1 episode of RTI, the most recent episode was counted as separate only if the patient fully recovered from the previous episode and there was a least a 3-week interval between the onset of the 2 episodes. Clinical, laboratory, and radiological data and the contact history of each patient were retrieved. Comorbidities were assessed in all patients based on the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI). 10 Steroid use was defined as the receipt of corticosteroid treatment (10 mg prednisolone or an equivalent daily dosage) for more than 2 weeks. An immunocompromised state was diagnosed if the patients met one of the following conditions: corticosteroid treatment, solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell recipient, or chemotherapy for an underlying malignancy during the past 6 months.\\n\\nNasopharyngeal or throat swabs were obtained from all patients and collected in transport medium, as previously described. 11 for virus detection and identification by both virus isolation and PCR/ESI-MS. Clinical specimens were stored at 48C and transported to the study sites within 24 hours of collection. Throat swabs from 42 cases without respiratory infections during the month prior to enrollment were included as control samples for PCR/ESI-MS analysis, including 15 patients with exclusively bacterial infections (documented cases of bacteremia or urinary tract infection) who were admitted to NCKUH and 27 individuals without active infections. These subjects without active infections included 10 patients with stable chronic diseases followed up in NCKUH clinics and 17 healthy individuals whose medical information was collected using a clinical questionnaire.\\n\\nThe study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (B-ER-101-031) of the study hospital, and all patients provided informed consent.\\n\\nRespiratory specimens were inoculated onto appropriate tissue cultures (Madin-Darby canine kidney, MRC-5, A549, and rhabdomyosarcoma) to isolate human influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, genus Enterovirus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and -2), and varicella zoster virus (VZV). The isolation and identification of viruses were performed using a previously described method 11 and enteroviruses were identified by a immunofluorescence assay using a Chemicon Pan EV mix that cross-reacts with rhinovirus (Light Diagnostics, Chemicon [Millipore], MA). 11, 12 Virus Detection and Identification by PCR/ESI-MS Total nucleic acids were extracted from 700 mL of swab samples using a nucleic acid autoextractor (MagNA Pure Compact Instrument, Mannheim, Germany), and the eluate was stored at À808C until analysis. During the analyses, the extracted nucleic acids were added to both a PLEX-ID Respiratory Virus assay plate and a PLEX-ID Broad Viral I assay plate (PLEX-ID, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, Illinois). The PLEX-ID Respiratory Virus assay detects human adenovirus, hCoV, hMPV, influenza A and B, parainfluenza types 1 to 3, and RSV, 6 whereas the PLEX-ID Broad Viral I assay detects human adenovirus, enterovirus, rhinovirus, BK and JC polyomavirus, parvovirus B19, HSV-1 and -2, VZV, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), CMV, and human herpesvirus (HHV)-8. 13, 14 In this study, respiratory viruses refer to adenovirus, hCoV, hMPV, influenza, parainfluenza, RSV, enterovirus, and rhinovirus. Nucleic acid amplification and analyses of PCR products were conducted using the PCR/ESI-MS platform (PLEX-ID, Abbott Laboratories) following the manufacturer's instructions, with test turnaround time from sample to result within 6 to 8 hours. 8, 13 The PCR/ESI-MS analyses included automated PCR desalting, ESI-MS signal acquisition, spectral analysis, and data reporting. Organism identification was based on the total mass and base compositions of the PCR amplicons compared with those in the molecular signature database established by the PLEX-ID manufacturer. 6, 8, 13, 14 Samples in which PCR/ESI-MS results disagreed with culture results at the species level were reexamined by a second molecular method. For enteroviruses, rhinovirus was differentiated from enterovirus using a conventional PCR sequencing analysis with the previously described primers (Rhinovirus s1 and as) and a BLAST search. 15 \\n\\nAll analyses were performed with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 17.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). Continuous variables were expressed as mean values AE standard deviations and were compared using the analysis of variance test. Categorical variables were compared using the Fisher exact test or x 2 test. All biologically plausible variables with a P value 0.10 in the univariate analysis were considered for inclusion in the logistic regression model for the multivariate analysis. A P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant, and all tests were 2-tailed.\\n\\nDuring the 9-month study period, a total of 267 episodes of acute RTIs from 263 patients were recorded, including 96 episodes at a local clinic and 171 episodes at NCKUH (19 outpatient and 152 in the emergency departments). For convenience, each episode was counted as 1 case. Overall, 123 (46.1%) cases were male patients, and 152 (56.9%), 60 (22.5%), and 55 (20.6%) patients were 18 to 39, 40 to 59, and !60 years of age, respectively. Two-hundred and twelve (79.4%) patients presented with upper RTIs (URTIs), and 55 (20.6%) cases presented with LRTIs. Compared with patients attending the local clinic, patients attending the medical care center were older and had more comorbidities ( Table 1 ). The detailed demographic data of the 267 RTI cases and 42 control cases are presented in Table 1 .\\n\\nAll 267 respiratory samples from each RTI case were examined for viruses by both virus isolation and PCR/ESI-MS, and the results are presented in Table 2 . For virus isolation, respiratory viruses were detected in 63 (23.6%) cases, including influenza A (48 cases, 18.0%), enterovirus (13, 4.9%), and parainfluenza virus (2, 0.7%), and no coinfection was detected. Virus isolation identified additional parainfluenza type 3 and enterovirus infections that were not found by PCR/ESI-MS in 2 samples.\\n\\nBy PCR/ESI-MS, respiratory viruses were detected in 126 cases (47.2%). Influenza A (65 cases, 24.3%) was the most frequently identified virus, among which 36 (13.5%) cases were subtyped as pandemic H1N1/09 virus, 28 (10.5%) cases as seasonal H3N2 virus, and 1 case as influenza A matching both pandemic H1N1and seasonal H3N2. Genus Enterovirus (34, 12.7%) was the second-most frequently detected virus, including rhinovirus (25, 9 .4%), enterovirus (8, 3.0%), and 1 culturenegative case matching for both rhinovirus and enterovirus. hCoV (13, 4 .9%), hMPV (10, 3.7%), adenovirus (6, 2.2%), RSV (6, 2.2%), and parainfluenza (4, 1.5%) were detected in small proportions of cases. Simultaneous detection of more than 1 respiratory virus was observed in 11 (4.1%) patients, and rhinovirus (5 cases) was most likely to be codetected with another respiratory virus ( Table 2 ). Of note, 4 cultivated viruses identified as enterovirus because of reactivity with the Chemicon Pan EV mix were characterized as rhinovirus by PCR/ESI-MS. Further PCR-sequencing analysis of the 4 clinical specimens confirmed the existence of rhinoviruses but not enteroviruses. PCR/ESI-MS identified additional respiratory viruses in 65 culture-negative samples, mostly rhinovirus (21 samples), and a second respiratory virus in 3 culture-positive influenza A samples. Overall, the positive detection rates for any respiratory virus by culture, PCR/ESI-MS, and both methods were 23.6%, 47.2%, and 47.9% (128/267), respectively. Of 61 specimens positive by both methods, PCR/ESI-MS and culture methods reached levels of agreement of 100% at the species level for influenza and parainfluenza and 100% at the genus level for the genus Enterovirus. In the control group, only 1 (2.4%) healthy individual tested positive for a respiratory virus (rhinovirus) by PCR/ESI-MS.\\n\\nWith respect to herpesviruses, PCR/ESI-MS identified EBV, HSV-1, CMV, and VZV in 128 (47.9%), 25 (9.4%), 7 (2.6%), and 2 (0.7%) samples from RTI cases, with similar detection rates observed in the control group. There was no detection of polyomavirus, parvovirus B19, HSV-2, or HHV-8 virus in samples from cases with RTIs or the control group.\\n\\nCases that tested positive for any respiratory virus either by culture or by PCR/ESI-MS were analyzed. The positive detection rates declined with age: 55.3%, 41.7%, and 34.5% in the 18-39, 40-59, and !60-year-old groups, respectively (P ¼ 0.02) ( Figure 1A) . A higher positivity rate was observed in patients with URTIs than that in patients with LRTIs (50.5% vs. 38.2%, P ¼ 0.10) ( Table 3 and Figure 1B ). There were similar distributions of respiratory viruses in cases from the local clinical and the medical center (Table 2) , and between patients from the 3 age groups ( Figure 1A ). Of 128 cases with identifiable respiratory viruses, non-influenza virus infection was more common in patients with LRTIs than those with URTIs (81.0% [17/21] vs. 48.6% [52/107], P ¼ 0.007). Rhinovirus (12.7%), influenza A (10.9%), and parainfluenza (7.3%) were the 3 leading respiratory viruses involved in 55 cases of LRTIs, and parainfluenza was more frequently observed in the LRTI group than in the URTI group (Table 3 and Figure 1B ). There was no seasonal variation in any individual respiratory virus over the 9-month period.\\n\\nOf 128 patients with identifiable respiratory viruses, univariate analysis revealed that patients with 1 of the following conditions were more likely to have non-influenza respiratory virus infections: immunocompromised state, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and chronic renal failure receiving dialysis (OR 5.4, 95% CI 1.2-25.5, P ¼ 0.02). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that steroid use was an independent risk factor for rhinovirus infection (OR 15.3, 95% CI 1.5-154.7, P ¼ 0.02), active malignancy was an independent risk factor for hMPV infection (OR 29.3, 95% CI 2.4-358.1, P ¼ 0.008), and COPD was an independent risk factor for parainfluenza infection (OR 229.2, 95% CI 10.5-5020.8,\\n\\nWhile comparing the URTI and LRTI groups, factors found to be associated with LRTI by univariate analysis included old age (!60 years), a high comorbidity index, congestive heart failure, COPD, malignancy, immunocompromised state, and detection of parainfluenza or EBV, whereas detection of influenza A was less frequently associated with LRTI. Codetection of respiratory virus was not associated with the development of LRTI. By multivariate analysis, only old age, immunocompromised state, and detection of parainfluenza remained 3 independent factors associated with LRTI (Table 3) .\\n\\nAmong the 117 episodes of single respiratory virus infections, arthralgia was more frequently observed in influenza A infections than in non-influenza infections (66.1% [39/59] vs. 46.6% [27/58], P ¼ 0.033); for these 2 types of infections, the other examined symptoms, including sore throat, rhinorrhea, cough, purulent sputum, wheezing, dyspnea, and headache, were detected at similar frequencies.\\n\\nOf 55 cases of LRTIs, coinfection with bacterial pathogens by sputum culture or blood culture was found in 3 (8.8%) of 34 patients who tested positive for respiratory viruses and in 2 (9.5%) of 21 patients who tested negative for respiratory viruses. Four of 6 cases of influenza A LRTI had received oseltamivir. Two patients died of pneumonia and the worsening of an underlying malignancy; 1 of these patients tested positive for hMPV, and the other patient tested negative for a respiratory virus. Four \\n\\nOur study of the viral epidemiology of adult acute RTI using PCR/ESI-MS technology has 3 major advantages. First, we expanded on previous studies utilizing PCR/ESI-MS for respiratory virus detection. The PLEX-ID Broad Viral I assay, which targets enterovirus, rhinovirus, herpesviruses, JC and BK polyomaviruses, and parvovirus B19, and the PLEX-ID Respiratory Virus assay tests were both adopted for the detection of multiple clinically relevant respiratory viruses. Second, 2 control groups (patients with exclusively bacterial infections and individuals without active infections) were enrolled to eliminate false-positive artifacts of NATs and estimate the prevalence of detectable asymptomatic carriers of respiratory viruses. Third, this study enrolled immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients visiting a local clinic or a medical center who presented with an URTI or LRTI, which reflects the true viral epidemiology of adult RTIs.\\n\\nBy supplementing the conventional culture method with PCR/ESI-MS, a 2-fold increase in the respiratory virus detection rate was achieved, from 23.6% by culture alone to 47.9% by a combination of both methods. Diagnostic gain was observed for both culturable viruses, especially rhinovirus, and fastidious viruses. Although we did not compare an alternative NAT due to sample volume limitations, it has been reported that PCR/ ESI-MS has a high sensitivity (92.9-100%) and specificity (99-100%) for variable respiratory virus detection relative to immunologic and PCR-based methods as gold standard assays, with the exception of parainfluenza (sensitivity 63.4%). 6 Coincidentally, we found that parainfluenza type 3 was 1 of only 2 viruses that were not detected by PCR/ESI-MS. The potential causes contributing to the lower detection rate for parainfluenza remain to be explored.\\n\\nThe positive detection rate (47.2%) for respiratory viruses by PCR/ESI-MS in the present study was similar to those of parallel adult surveillance programs using NATs (43.2-57%). 5,16-18 but notably higher than an earlier study using the Ibis T5000 biosensor system (the prototype of PCR-ESI/ MS) using the respiratory virus surveillance II kit (35.9%), likely because the kit was not designed for the detection of enterovirus and rhinovirus. 8 Enterovirus and rhinovirus, both members of the Enterovirus genus, contributed to 13.1% of RTI cases in our study and 9.8-17.8% of adult cases in other studies. 5, 16, 17 Considering their prevalence, enterovirus and rhinovirus should be included in the diagnostic panels of respiratory viruses if comprehensive viral detection is indicated.\\n\\nThe codetection rate (4.1%) was within the range of 2.0-7.2% that has been reported elsewhere. 5, 16, 17 and rhinovirus was the virus most frequently involved in coinfections, probably due to its high prevalence throughout the year. 18 Influenza A and rhinovirus were the 2 most frequently detected respiratory viruses, whereas hCoV, hMPV, enterovirus, adenovirus, RSV, and parainfluenza were detected in small proportions of cases. This finding is similar to the viral epidemiology of adult RTIs observed by other study groups. 5, 16, 17 The similar distributions of viruses between cases from a local clinic and a medical center and between patients of the 3 age groups suggest that individuals of all age groups are susceptible to multiple respiratory viruses that simultaneously circulate in the community. A lower positive detection rate was observed in the elderly population, probably because older adult patients shed lower titers of viruses. 19 However, the roles of EBV, HSV-1, and CMV in adult RTIs remain incompletely 20 Moreover, the univariate association between EBV and LRTIs observed in this study may have been caused by the confounding factor of age, particularly given that old age was identified as an independent factor for EBV detection (data not shown). The lack of detection of BK and JC polyomavirus or parvovirus B19 implies that these viruses play a minor role in adult RTIs and that oropharyngeal cells are not involved in BK and JC polyomavirus persistence. 21 Furthermore, the low positive detection rate for respiratory viruses in the control group suggests a low possibility of false-positive artifacts in PCR/ESI-MS or a lower rate of asymptomatic colonization of respiratory viruses. In addition to the advantage of sensitive detection, PCR/ ESI-MS possesses the capability of simultaneous subtype identification of respiratory viruses. 22 In this study, influenza A viruses were subtyped as pandemic H1N1 influenza A and seasonal H3N2 influenza. In Europe, both viruses cocirculated in the community in the 2012-2013 influenza season. 23 In the genus Enterovirus, acid-labile rhinovirus can be differentiated from enterovirus using an acid lability test. 24 while PCR/ESI-MS can rapidly differentiate the 2 species in a single test, as demonstrated in our study. The 13 hCoVs were subtyped as hCoV-OC43, -229E, and -HKU1, which was further validated by conventional PCR-sequencing assays (data not shown). The newly identified HCoV-NL63 was not detected during the study period, and a low detection rate (<1%) was reported in China. 16 Our understanding of the roles of non-influenza respiratory viruses in patients with comorbidities or LRTIs has been strengthened in our study. Patients who were undergoing steroid treatment, had an active malignancy, or suffered from COPD were at risk for rhinovirus, hMPV, or parainfluenza infections, respectively. Overall, immunocompromised patients, those with COPD, and patients receiving dialysis were at risk for non-influenza respiratory virus infection. Non-influenza virus infections were also more frequently involved in LRTIs than in URTIs. Among LRTIs, rhinovirus and parainfluenza were ranked as the first-and third-most common pathogens, respectively, and parainfluenza was an independent factor associated with LRTIs, a finding consistent with prior reports that both viruses are significant causes of LRTIs. 18, [25] [26] [27] On the other hand, despite an increasing role of non-influenza respiratory viruses, currently available antiviral agents and vaccines primarily target influenza infection. Although viral RTI is a self-limited illness, as observed in the majority of our patients with LRTIs who recovered from illness without the aid of antiviral agents, a definite etiological diagnosis can help to reduce the unwarranted use of anti-influenza agents or antimicrobials and/or unnecessary hospitalizations, and provide useful information for the control of RTIs. However, we observed that clinical differentiation of influenza infection from other respiratory virus infections is difficult due to overlapping symptoms, as described previously. 5 Collectively, the association of non-influenza virus infection with patients with comorbidities or LRTIs reported here suggests that a complete respiratory viral panel would be appropriate in the diagnostic work-up for RTIs in these populations. The additional costs incurred by the use of a complete panel of PCR/ESI-MS-based assessments or other molecular tests would likely be offset by the accompanying reductions in unnecessary antimicrobial therapy and/or hospitalization. 18 Our study has some limitations. First, parainfluenza type 4 and 3 newly identified respiratory viruses, human bocavirus, human polyomavirus KI and WU polyomavirus were not included in the panels. [28] [29] [30] [31] and their roles in adult RTIs in Taiwan are unclear. Second, although certain risk factors for specific virus infections, such as hMPV or parainfluenza infections, have been identified, these associations should be re-examined in additional largescale clinical studies, and the clinical impact and underlying mechanisms of these associations should be explored. Similarly, more control cases may be needed to better estimate the prevalence of asymptomatic carriers of respiratory viruses. Third, only 3 seasons were covered, and the seasonality of viral respiratory infections could not be demonstrated.\\n\\nIn conclusion, compared with virus isolation, PCR/ESI-MS produced a greater diagnostic yield for viral RTIs, with a low possibility of false-positive artifacts. Non-influenza respiratory virus infection was significantly associated with patients with comorbidities and with LRTIs. Additional studies to delineate the clinical need for and economic benefits of including non-influenza respiratory viruses in the diagnostic work-up in these populations are warranted.\"}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '914ef3433569e70c32aa384639f3790d'}>],\n",
